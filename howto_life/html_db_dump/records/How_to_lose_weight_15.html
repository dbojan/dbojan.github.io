note: <BR>
I will not bear responsibility for any of these advices. You are doing this on your own responsibility.<BR>
Consult with doctor before you do this.<BR>
<BR>
Eat more often, but less intake of food.<BR>
If you skip dinner, your body will think: <BR>
"There is not enough food in the outside world. I should make some extra supplies"<BR>
<BR>
If you eat regularly, your body will think: <BR>
"There is no lack of food outside. No need to stack supplies".<BR>
<BR>
Eat regularly. You should eat at least every 4 hours.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Stop eating when you are 80% full.<BR>
<BR>
If you are full, don't throw food in yourself, put it away, or trow it in a trash bin.<BR>
If you overstuff yourself, you are hurting yourself. You are more valuable than any food.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine a train furnace, where they put the cole in.<BR>
If you overfill it, it will not work ok. It might even explode :). Not that you will explode, anyway. :)<BR>
<BR>
Try to lower meat intake. Especially pig, and cow meat.<BR>
But beware of missing essential amino acid, calcium and vitamins like B,B12, and D.<BR>
Fish is OK?<BR>
<BR>
Do not eat candy, especially factory made candy.<BR>
<BR>
Do not use sugar. It just makes you want more. It creates a habbit. You should quit.<BR>
<BR>
If you have to eat sweets eat fruits, or butter or margarine (without hydrogenated oils), with honey or jam, on a slice of bread.<BR>
Remember to brush your teeth or at least rinse with water afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Do not drink soft drinks. (Colas, Cool-aid or whatever).<BR>
<BR>
You can drink tea without sugar.<BR>
Remember to brush your teeth or at least rinse with water afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
Do not drink alcohol. That includes beer.<BR>
<BR>
Exercise. At least in front of TV. If you watch it.<BR>
You can fill two big plastic bottles with water and use them as weights.<BR>
Walking for half an hour a day is also exercise.<BR>
<BR>
Eat a lot of fruit and vegetables. Remember to brush your teeth or at least rinse with water afterwards.<BR>
That includes brushing/rinsing after fruits?<BR>
<BR>
Drink enough water. So the body can eliminate toxins.<BR>
<BR>
Walk in pauses while eating, like you did when you were a kid.<BR>
Walk after eating. Don't go to sleep.<BR>
Dance, listen to a music while eating.<BR>
<BR>
You should not watch tv, or work on computer while eating.<BR>
Concentrate on the meal in front of you, not on TV.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
