When there is worry, there is usually fear hidden near.<BR>
There is no need for fear.<BR>
Everything happens for a reason.<BR>
There is a reason you are here now, doing what you are doing.<BR>
Worry = fear.<BR>
<BR>
Do not worry about material things. They will all perish in time anyway. Disintegrate.<BR>
<BR>
People :)<BR>
<BR>
A worries what B thinks of him.<BR>
B worries what A thinks of him<BR>
<BR>
So A does not think about B, nor B thinks of A. Some people only worry about themselves :)<BR>
People don't think about others. They think of themselves.<BR>
<BR>
People you worry about, would not want you to worry about them.<BR>
Like people you love and care about, and people who feel the same way about you.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Do you even remember, why you were worried yesterday? Does it matter today at all?<BR>
<BR>
Why don't you just skip the worrying part, and move to tomorrow? :)<BR>
Skip the worrying part, and save your self. The heartache. And pain and annoyance.<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes we see opportunities as a problem. <BR>
Even a problem can be  a chance to learn. <BR>
Say to yourself. I am able to do this.<BR>
This will be interesting opportunity to learn and experience something new.<BR>
Smile. Smile breaks fear.<BR>
Do not be afraid.<BR>
Believe in yourself.<BR>
You are not aware of all the power you posses , all the things you can do. <BR>
<BR>
Believe you can do it. Prepare well. Tell your self this will be easy and beautiful.<BR>
And interesting new experience. :)<BR>
<BR>
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.<BR>
from Bible<BR>
<BR>
So we are left with a PRESENT :)<BR>
<BR>
Avoid stressful events, stress triggers, or convert them to non stressful ones. Laughing at them can help relieve stress.<BR>
You can repair your body, if it was hurt by stress. It is simple. Just imagine yourself bathing in light coming from God. <BR>
Light is repairing your body and soul. Keep doing this from time to time. Or all the time.<BR>
<BR>
Here are some ways to relieve stress:<BR>
So when you are feeling down:<BR>
Gym, video games, running, box practice.<BR>
Sing, dance, laugh, love.<BR>
It helps if you have someone to love. A person or an animal, like a cat.<BR>
<BR>
Every time you feel stress, remember to start to heal you.<BR>
So you will turn stress into to alarm clock for healing. :)<BR>

<BR>
Do not let the stream of life carry you. You choose the destination and the way to get there. <BR>
<BR>
You are the ship commander. <BR>
Set the direction, and the goal. <BR>
Do not be afraid to take command.<BR>
Do not be afraid.<BR>
<BR>
You can solve the problem. But what you should do, is remove the cause for stresss.<BR>
Make the plan to solve the problem, and execute it.<BR>
That is all there is to it.<BR>
Create steps, then follow them one by one.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Do not get too attached to this life drama. It is just a video game :). Sort of.<BR>
from "Bringers of the Dawn"<BR>

Helps to avoid the stress. :)<BR>
