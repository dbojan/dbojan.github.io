<BR>
car:<BR>
-speed up before hill, not on the hill<BR>
-no more than 50-59 km/h the city. lower speed=lower air resistance.<BR>
-shift to lower gear when see red light 100m ahead<BR>
-keep rpms down, shift gears early. Bit not too early, you might damage your car.<BR>
-look up if there is red light 100 meters ahead of you.<BR>
-if yes, shift to lower gear, and let the car slowdown.<BR>
-don't accelerate too fast.<BR>

how to measure your car fuel consumption?<BR>
-fill your tank<BR>
-reset km counter<BR>
-drive till 3/4 empty. not empty all the way.<BR>
-refuel tank. Write down how much you filled, or look in invoice<BR>
Calculate. Here is howto example:<BR>
	You refilled 34 liters. Your counter shows 500km. <BR>
	34/500=0.68 . Your car uses 6.8 litres per 100 km.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, in a perfect world, people would drive electric car.<BR>
But then there would be nothing to sell. No oil, no spare parts, no filters...<BR>
