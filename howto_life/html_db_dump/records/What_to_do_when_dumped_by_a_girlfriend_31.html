Move on. That is probably what she would've wanted.<BR>
<BR>
It didn't work between you two, so she had to move on.<BR>
She has to find her match, and till she does, she will keep searching.<BR>
She had her reasons to do it, it is nothing personal.<BR>
<BR>
Move on. Walk it off. :)<BR>
<BR>
You are not the first or the last couple to break up.<BR>
You are not the first or the last, to dump, or to be dumped by someone.<BR>
You have exited a relationship.<BR>
<BR>
Be nice to her. It is difficult when you have to break up with someone.<BR>
You will see it yourself.<BR>
You might have to leave someone someday, then you will understand.<BR>
It is nothing personal. It just happens sometime.<BR>
<BR>
As funny as it seems, "I hope we can still be friends", is the one/only thing you can say.<BR>
Try to stay friends/on friendly terms, if possible.<BR>
Her intension was NOT to hurt you, but to free herself from the relationship that did not work.<BR>
Her intension was NOT to hurt you. Unfortunately, every severing of the connections hurt.<BR>
In time it will become ...  manageable :)<BR>
<BR>
You <BR>
have <BR>
to <BR>
move <BR>
on.<BR>
:( <BR>
:)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Your frequencies change. Just like your taste in music change. You were not at the same frequency. Same wave length.<BR>
So she had to move on. You have to. And find a new partner. Who is waiting for you. Maybe :)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
