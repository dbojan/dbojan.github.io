Our body is a computer. Our body is programmable. It does what we program it to do. <BR>
If we program it to get well it will. How do you program your body?<BR>
<BR>
Simple, tell it what you want, and it will do it. Love it. Trust it.<BR>
<BR>
It will behave the way you tell it to. Like a computer.<BR>
<BR>
If we trust it, and love it it will flourish. If we doubt it, put worry in it,<BR>
it will start malfunctioning.<BR>
<BR>
Love your body.<BR>
<BR>
Be proud of it.<BR>
<BR>
You are unique, there isn't one like you in the whole universe :)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
