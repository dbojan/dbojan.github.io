<BR>
Your soul goes back to reunite with the God.<BR>
Same thing happens with others.<BR>
You feel everything you did to others, like you did it to yourself.<BR>
So be careful what you do...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another point of view:<BR>
You are the doer, and you are also the subject. Since we are all one...<BR>
Connected.<BR>
<BR>
But since soul cannot be damaged, any pain we perceive is ... an illusion, no matter how real it might seem to us.<BR>
Served to us to have a new experience, and with such, grow, evolve.<BR>
And, it is only temporary.<BR>
<BR>
But, you have a choice. Remember that.<BR>
