When woman talks about her problems or some event, she does NOT want you to solve her problem.<BR>
All you have to do is keep saying is yes, aha, hm, and nod your head.<BR>
<BR>
It is difficult for men not to try to solve women's problems, but that is not what they want.<BR>
If you offer them solution they will still talk, regardless.<BR>
<BR>
Women share emotions, and create feeling of unity by sharing (stories).<BR>
They do not tell men their problems, because they need solution. They don't.<BR>
They just need to speak to you. To SHARE. <BR>
So DO NOT try to solve her problems. In women talk, you are NOT expected to solve her problems.<BR>
Just listen.<BR>
<BR>
She will be grateful, and you will achieve success in this :).<BR>
Such was this task. To listen. NOT to solve (the problem).<BR>
