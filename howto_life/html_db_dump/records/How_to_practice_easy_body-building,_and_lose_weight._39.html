Find plastic bottles 2.5 liters.<BR>
Fill them with water.<BR>
After each meal, wait 10 min or so, then lift them up and down 15 times, while breathing normally.<BR>
Lift them sideways about 5 times. Spread your arms to each side. Connect them above your head.<BR>
Breathe deeply.<BR>
<BR>
You can also do this while watching movies. Even in bed. (1st exercise).<BR>

If you dont eat meat, you will not have fat on your stomach, and muscles will be more visible.<BR>
Fish is ok.<BR>
<BR>
If you don't eat meat, remember to eat various vegetables, and have vitamins, to stay healthy. <BR>
Consult your nutritionist, or a doctor, or search the net. See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Skinny-Bitch-Rory-Freedman/dp/0762424931">here</a>.<BR>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.scoobysworkshop.com/6packabs.htm">Here</a> is an interesting site. You don't have to have muscles that big, it is more about healthy eating and healthy eating habits.<BR>

"You cant lose weight eating one or two meals a day, it puts your body in starvation mode and lowers your metabolism.  You need 3-6 meals a day."<BR>
I agree completely. :)<BR>
