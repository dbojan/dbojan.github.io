<BR>
2. When you store a condom to use it later, keep it in a cool, dry place, so as not to damage it. In practical terms, this means that you shouldn't keep condoms in your pocket or wallet for a long time. Backpacks and purses are better places.<BR>
<BR>
3. When you are in a sexual situation and about to begin to have oral, anal or vaginal sex, open the package carefully (watch your fingernails!), and remove the condom.<BR>
<BR>
4. You will find that it is rolled up, and at this point you need to differentiate the inside from the outside. How to tell? You can make the condom look like a sombrero--with the thick, rolled-up part on the outside--so that you can roll it easily over the erect penis.<BR>
<BR>
5. After you know which side of the condom is the inside, you need to make sure there is space at the top, and if there is a nipple at the top, that it isn't full of air. This will allow semen to collect in the reservoir at the top, and will prevent the condom from breaking.<BR>
<BR>
6. Pinch the tip of the condom to squeeze the air out of the condom. This is important, because if the air is not squeezed out, the condom could break.<BR>
<BR>
7. For guys who are circumcised: Place the condom on the head of the erect penis and roll it all the way down to the base of the penis.<BR>
<BR>
For guys who aren't circumcised: Before putting a condom on, make sure the foreskin of your penis (the skin around the head of your penis) is pulled back exposing the head of your penis. Then pinch the tip of the condom and place the condom on the head of the erect penis and roll it all the way down to the base of the penis. (If your foreskin is very tight and won't go down, you need to see a doctor for help with a possible adhesion.<BR>
<BR>
8. You may choose to use a condom for all three types of sex: vaginal, oral, and anal in order to get the most protection possible from pregnancy and STDs.<BR>
<BR>
9. After ejaculation, hold the condom at the base of the penis and withdraw the penis. Carefully remove the condom from the penis, making sure that none of the semen seeps out by tying a knot at the end.<BR>
<BR>
10. Wrap the condom in a tissue and throw it away; do not flush it down the toilet.<BR>
<BR>
11. Never reuse a condom! Consider practicing this on yourself (if you're a guy) or on an object (if you're a girl), so that you'll know exactly what you're doing. When used correctly and consistently, condoms are 98-percent effective at preventing STDs and pregnancy! But just in case the condom breaks, check out this info on emergency contraception.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You might use lubricants on penis, before putting the condom on it, to make it more sensitive. (Haven't tried that.)<BR>
<BR>
<b>Do not use oils or oil-based lubricants with latex condoms!</b> They will break. You can use water based lubricants with latex condoms.<BR>
<BR>
Polyurethane condoms can be used with oils or oil based lubricants.<BR>
