Ask her in casual conversation if she has boyfriend.<BR>
<BR>
If she says yes, unless she just likes having someone around (which is a bad sign), your chances are slim.<BR>
I suggest you quit.<BR>
<BR>
Talk to her, see if she is interested in you. How will you know?<BR>
If she stands close to you, smiles at your jokes, looks you straight in the eye all the time,<BR>
touches your clothes, asks your sign (in horoscope)...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How to ask her?<BR>
Do it yourself. :)<BR>
Really. You are not the first or the last. Think of what you will say go to her and ask her.<BR>
If during conversation it seem it might not happen, quit.<BR>
<BR>
If you ase her, and she says no, don't worry about it. Consider it a practice :) .<BR>
Besides, someday some girl might ask you out, and you might have to say no. <BR>
It is not that bad, and it is nothing personal.<BR>
<BR>
Do not send someone else to do it for you. She will see it as you are not interested enough to ask her yourself.<BR>
Or, you do not value her enough, to make an effort.<BR>
<BR>
Besides, most girls want someone to ask them out. Perhaps not by you, though ... :)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Remember this: girls are just as insecure as boys are. Even more. :)<BR>
Hardly any women is satisfied with her body. Weird huh? :)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
