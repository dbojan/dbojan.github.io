Here is one way to explain:<BR>
<BR>
Do you know how, when you put plant seeds in the earth,  and then after some time the fruit comes out (on the plant)?<BR>
Same thing.<BR>
<BR>
First a bit of an explanation about sex:<BR>
When two people are in love, they like to do things together. Sex is one of these things.<BR>
During sex, men puts his penis in woman's vagina. If feels good, so some people like to do it often.<BR>
It's like dancing, only more intense.<BR>
<BR>
During sex men puts seed inside of women. Seed is in a sort of a liquid form.<BR>
Inside a woman's body, semen is joined with the second part needed to make a baby: an egg.<BR>
(Egg is produced by a woman's body.)<BR>
<BR>
Baby grows inside a woman's uterus (like a pocket in kangaroo) for 9 months and then comes outside.<BR>
