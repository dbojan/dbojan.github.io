Then join some school or club.<BR>
<BR>
Start talking to people. If you want to ask them something, do it.<BR>
Be polite and nice to people. Don't lose your head. <BR>
Don't worry too much about your ego, for example don't get too excited if someone insults you, just smile it off.<BR>
<BR>
Don't worry about being perfect, noone expects you to be. :)<BR>
So, relax. :) <BR>
Do the things you always wanted, experience them (but not to the expense of others.)<BR>
