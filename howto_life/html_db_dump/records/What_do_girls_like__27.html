</center><P><P>tags: <a href='../tags/girls.html'>girls</a> <a href='../tags/life.html'>life</a> <a href='../tags/howto.html'>howto</a>  <p>Most girls like:<BR>
-selflessness<BR>
-kindness<BR>
-guys taking initiative. Ask first, or offer help, ...<BR>
-guys with manners (open door, hold a chair)<BR>
-self confidence - but not too much<BR>
-not talking too much about themselves<BR>
-not trying to feel girls with their hands on the first date.<BR>
-showing interest in more than just a girl's look. What does she do, what does she like?<BR>
<BR>
-guys listening to girls. (Without trying to solve their problems)<BR>
-guys remembering important dates, like birthdays, anniversaries. (Use address book with reminder.)<BR>
-guys remembering what girls say. Their likes and dislikes.<BR>
<BR>
-guys being (a little) jealous. For girls, this is a proof of love.  <BR>
-guys not looking at girls breasts during conversation<BR>
-guys not checking out others girls as they walk by.<BR>
-guys offering help. With work, and in the house.<BR>
<BR>
-protective guys - who would offer jacket to keep her warm on a cold day.<BR>
-guys with a sense of humor. That does not mean sprouting jokes all the time. And when things are important to be serious.<BR>
-truth<BR>
-truth about relation ship, even if it might hurt.<BR>
-they like to see a guy make an effort - cook a dinner, plan a date. <BR>
(you shouldn't say I dont know where shall we go, but if you do, offer places/plans. )<BR>
<BR>
-they dont like guys cheating on them. (Kinda obvious)<BR>
-they dont like guys being late, or unreliable. (Honor a promise)<BR>
<BR>
-they like guys showing emotions, but not crying all the time.<BR>
-strong shoulder to lean on. (from time to time :) )<BR>
<BR>
-they like it when guys hug/hold her. Tight. But not so tight she can't breathe.<BR>
-Some phrases can make her feel a lot better, if she feels sad/hurt:<BR>
 -"It will be ok."<BR>
 -"Don't worry."<BR>
 -"It's gonna be allright."<BR>
 -"We'll get through this together."<BR>
<BR>
Which makes sense. These are the things you would like to hear when you are down, too.<BR>
<BR>
And of course: "I love you". They need to hear that every every hour of every day. And it's ... nice :) <BR>
As with everything, say it only if you really mean it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-guys pretending they are something they are not, so they can charm a girl. :)<BR>
So guys, don't be something you are not, just to impress the girl.<BR>
Change has to come from the inside, not from the outside.<BR>
Otherwise it is only make-believe, and it's only temporary.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
