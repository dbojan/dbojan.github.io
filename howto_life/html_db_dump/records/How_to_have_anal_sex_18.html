First talk with your girlfriend/wife about it. If she doesn't want to do it, it's not going to happen.<BR>
You can try talking to her few times about it. Don't try to pressure her, if she is not into it.<BR>
Don't try to find a willing participant outside the marriage/relationship, that will end badly.<BR>
<BR>
If she agrees here are some advices:<BR>
<BR>
Shower before. <BR>
<BR>
Use a condom.<BR>
<BR>
Make sure she is aroused.<BR>
Make sure you are well lubricated. Her too.<BR>
<BR>
Go slowly. You don't want to hurt her.<BR>
<BR>
You, or her, stimulate her clit.<BR>

"penetrate that area, gently at first, withdraw and re-lube a couple of times, donâ€™t be anxious, stop immediately if things get awkward"<BR>
