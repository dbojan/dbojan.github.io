<BR>
Face your fears.<BR>
Tell yourself: "So what if we don't have a kid. It's not the end of the world."<BR>
Don't let the fear paralyzes your body, and your partner. <BR>
<BR>
Relax, and have fun.<BR>
Try to have sex <b>without</b> getting pregnant.<BR>
Without the pressure. Maybe drink a <u>little</u> wine to loosen the spirits. And with lots of love.<BR>
<BR>

"You know, baseball is a thing that if you push too hard... <BR>
you get exactly the opposite of what you're trying for."<BR>
-"This time, swing to miss."<BR>
-"Okay. That's easy."<BR>
from the movie "Three Wishes (1995)"<BR>
<BR>
So, don't push to hard. :)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pray. Play. Dance.<BR>
Visualize your family, with a kid, smiling, being happy.<BR>
<BR>
Visit bioenergetic practitioner. Sometimes there is a block in a flow of energy. Or not :)<BR>
Sometimes a massage can help. Acupuncture? Massage?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is not your fault, just as having particular eyes color is not your fault.<BR>
<BR>
You can always adopt :). Many kids need parents.<BR>
Smile. Enjoy your life. Having a child is not the only thing in the world. :)<BR>
Who knows, maybe when you stop trying ... you will get a surprise ;)<BR>
