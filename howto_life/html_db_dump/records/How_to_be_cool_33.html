<BR>
<b>You don't need to impress everyone</b>/be the coolest guy there. Remember that. <BR>
Don't try to be cool and impress everyone. Relax, and enjoy yourself.<BR>
<BR>
It's like in baseball. The best way to hit a ball, is to stop trying <b>too hard</b> to hit it.<BR>
<BR>
"You know, baseball is a thing that if you push too hard... <BR>
you get exactly the opposite of what you're trying for."<BR>
-"This time, swing to miss."<BR>
-"Okay. That's easy."<BR>
from the movie "Three Wishes (1995)"<BR>
<BR>
Another thing:<BR>
You don't have to be perfect. <b>You don't need to win every game</b>. Just do your best, but remember to have fun. :)<BR>
Don't hate/envy others if they are better than you are.<BR>
Be happy for them :)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If you disagree with someone, say it. If you have a question, ask it. Others are probably asking themselves the same thing.<BR>
Don't be afraid to speak your mind. You don't have to agree with everyone. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Protect the weak ones.<BR>
Share.<BR>
<BR>
Do what you want/need to do, don't do it because others do it. Or because others tell you to do.<BR>
<BR>
Try to have some fun. (not at the expense of others, though.)<BR>
<BR>
Be nice to girls. And others. But especially to girls. :)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guess what: others are just as scared and confused as you are :) <BR>
They haven't got it all figured out.<BR>
Even those pretty girls. :) <BR>
They are just good at hiding it :)<BR>
So relax. And enjoy. And remember to smile. :)<BR>
