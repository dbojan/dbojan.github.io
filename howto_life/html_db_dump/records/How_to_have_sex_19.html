<br><BR>
Look for a book titled: "The Female Orgasm Black Book" by Lee Jenkins.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Look up the appearance of female sexual organs on the internet. Vulva<BR>
(everything including the vagina), clitoris, clitoral<BR>
hood,&nbsp;outer labia, inner labia, the whole female reproductive<BR>
system.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
You can trim your hair in pubic area a bit.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Watch your hygiene. Cut your fingernails and toenails.<br><BR>
Make sure you are clean. Wash your penis with water and soap if you<BR>
want. Remember to wash out soap. (More on the <a href="How_to_keep_personal_hygiene_38.html">hygiene</a>).<BR>
Take a shower.<br><BR>
Have clean underwear.<br><BR>
Shave. Girls take a long time to prepare for the one they love. If you<BR>
come to see her, or greet her in an old t-shirt, smelly and unshaven,<BR>
she will think you dont like her much, since you did<BR>
not put an effort to prepare for a meeting with her.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mood<br><BR>
</span> Create an atmosphere, a mood, with:<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><BR>
Music<br><BR>
</span> Put on some nice sensual music, or sexual music. Google<BR>
for it.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lighting</span><br><BR>
Tone the light down, or use a lamp.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scents</span><br><BR>
For scents, use scented candles and/or burning incense.<br><BR>
Scents are very important.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Turn the phone off, AFTER she arrives. You can remove the wall clock if<BR>
you want, but it is kind of bad idea.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Compliment her<br><BR>
</span> Tell her how good she looks. Or compliment the way dress<BR>
looks on her. Not just the dress.<br><BR>
Be different. Comment on her hairstyle. Don't just say: "You look<BR>
pretty", although, that is better than nothing.<br><BR>
Make her feel good.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Get her relaxed</span><br><BR>
You can shower together if you want, or take a bath together.<br><BR>
This will get your bodies clean and relaxed.<br><BR>
Some women like to be undressed by men. And then kissed all over. <BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Get playfully to the<BR>
massage part.</span><br><BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<b>Watch her body language</b>.<br><BR>
Learn to read it. Learn to recognize what she likes, or dislikes. <br><BR>
<br><BR>
<b>Stimulate her erogenous zones</b><br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Time</span><br><BR>
Women need more time&nbsp;to reach orgasm than men.<br><BR>
They need to be stimulated longer. They need to be stimulated for some<BR>
time, before the "penis enters the vagina" part.<br><BR>
You can do this by stimulating her body (massage, kisses, touches) or<BR>
her mind (whispering sweet nothings into her ear. :)&nbsp;)<br><BR>
That way you can get her hot, and wet, so she can orgasm before, or at<BR>
the same time with you.<br><BR>
If you have orgasm before her, you should try to help her reach orgasm<BR>
too, otherwise you are just being selfish.&nbsp;:)<br><BR>
You can, for example, use your finger(s).<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Although, if you or her don't reach orgasm, it is not the end of the<BR>
world. If you want, you (both of you), can relax and start again, later.<br><BR>
Sex should be fun and joy. Not a place for ego tripping.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stimulation</span><br><BR>
Women's erogenous zones are not just her lips, breasts, and her vagina.<br><BR>
When kissing her, kiss her all over.&nbsp;<br><BR>
Kiss her cheeks, her lips,&nbsp;ears (VERY sensitive :), you can<BR>
try gently biting them a little :),&nbsp;forehead, collar bone,<BR>
neck, shoulders, back of her neck, her back.<br><BR>
Kiss the small of her back (part above her butt, that some girls like to<BR>
have tattoo on), her belly, spine, line from her belly button to her<BR>
breasts.<br><BR>
Collarbones. Inside part of her elbows, and knees.<br><BR>
Kiss her all over.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Keep body contact. People in love usually try to be close to each<BR>
other, their bodies touching all the time.<br><BR>
Keep an eye contact. Say her name a lot. Or call her honey, or sweetie,<BR>
or sunshine, or dear, or love (only if you mean it).<br><BR>
<br><BR>
First hold her neck or her head. Pull her towards you gently, and then<BR>
kiss her [lips].<br><BR>
When standing together move you hands all over her back, while you are<BR>
kissing her.&nbsp;<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Before sex, don't just kiss her lips, breasts and vagina.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Whisper sweet things (no swearing) to her ears. Tell her what you will<BR>
do to her. <br><BR>
<br><BR>
You can dance together then start kissing. Make sure the beginning<BR>
doesn't feel forced.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparing for the massage</span><br><BR>
Put two towels on the bed You can do this before she comes over. Help<BR>
her undress, or watch her while she is doing it. Or undress eachother.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The massage<br><BR>
</span> Ask&nbsp;her to lie down on her stomach. Use some<BR>
baby oil. Don't be cheap. You can use a lot of it. But not too much.<BR>
(Laughter is good.)<br><BR>
Give her a massage, from the back of her neck to her feet. You can be<BR>
firm.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Watch her body, read her<BR>
body signs. Keep an eye contact.</span><br><BR>
Keep a steady rhythm over her back. Make it in a slow rhythmic movements.<br><BR>
Glide. <br><BR>
Knead, like making a bread. <br><BR>
Use circular movement if you encounter a knot in her muscle.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
She will breathe deeply if you hit the spot. :)<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Dont forget to massage her arms too.<br><BR>
Don't relax her too much, or she will fall a sleep.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Go quickly over her ass, then come back.<br><BR>
Pay special attention to the inside of her thighs and her vagina. <br><BR>
Use more oil on her ass. Let it spill. She will like it. :)<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Don't put oil on her vagina. (It might damage the&nbsp;(most often <BR>
used) latex condom, making it leakable.)<br><BR>
If you can, use polyurethane condoms, which are resistant to oil.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Now, ask her (politely) to turn on her back. Repeat the procedure going<BR>
from her neck to her toes. Try to keep an eye contact.<br><BR>
Stick around at the breast area.<br><BR>
Go to her toes, then go back to her inner thighs and vagina.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Now you have to wash your hands. Oil don't mix well with condom.<br><BR>
Hurry up and come back.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
She can give you a massage, if you both want it.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Labial (vaginal lips) area</span><br><BR>
Watch her body, read her body signs. Keep an eye contact.<br><BR>
She will breathe deeply if you hit the spot, and/or arch her body.<br><BR>
Be gentle.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Don't put penis inside of her right away. First you have to make her<BR>
wet. It will ease the entering of the penis, as well increase the<BR>
pleasure for her. Always make sure she has an orgasm before<BR>
you. (Or two, or three :) )<br><BR>
Women take longer time to get aroused, so you should get her aroused<BR>
first, before entering the vagina.<br><BR>
If you come to fast, masturbate before the event.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Now the vagina. :)<br><BR>
<br><BR>
GENTLY, massage area around her outer lips. Don't touch inner lips, or clitoris just yet.<br><BR>
Clit is very sensitive.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Massaging the vulva. (The<BR>
whole area.)</span><br><BR>
You can use pillow if it is hard for you to keep an eye contact in the<BR>
next stage.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Kiss her outer lips. Slowly. First left, then right one. You can go in<BR>
half-circle, from top to bottom. 5 kisses.<br><BR>
Kiss her inner lips. Slowly. First left, then right one. You can go in<BR>
half-circle, from top to bottom. 5 kisses.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
The next step is:<br><BR>
Move your tongue from the bottom of her vagina, to the top. At the top is the clitoral hood.<br><BR>
Increase pressure here, and go from left to right. Pause 2 seconds. Now<BR>
go back with your tongue. Move your tongue down to the bottom of her<BR>
vagina. Don't lift it while doing this.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Repeat 10-20 times.<br><BR>
First go all the way to the top, hold, go back. Repeat 5-6 times.<br><BR>
Then go half way, go back. Repeat 5-6 times.<br><BR>
Then mix.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Flick a tongue over her clit few times.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Entering her (first with<BR>
your finger)</span><br><BR>
Don't go inside of her with your fingers or your penis until she is<BR>
wet. It will hurt her.<br><BR>
Put you finger inside&nbsp;her slowly. <br><BR>
Keep licking her (Try licking her clit.). Stimulate her vagina with<BR>
your finger. <br><BR>
<br><BR>
With palm up, put your middle finger inside her vagina.<br><BR>
Move middle finger toward your palm, in a sort of "come here" move. You<BR>
can try to find her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Spot">g-spot</a>,<BR>
which should be on the top of the vaginal wall:<br><BR>
"Bean-shaped ... , g-spot is typically located one to three inches (2.5<BR>
to 7.6 cm) up the front (anterior) vaginal wall between the vaginal<BR>
opening and the urethra[3] and is a sensitive area that may be part of<BR>
the female prostate."<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Some girls like different, more penetrative move where you simulate<BR>
penis movement with your middle finger (in and out).<br><BR>
Your palm is still up, and when your finger is all the way in, your<BR>
palm makes contact with the outside of the vagina.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Keep doing this until she has an orgasm. (If not, proceed to the next<BR>
point, or repeat it.)<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Enter with your penis, when she is ready. She will tell you if she<BR>
can't hold it any more :)<br><BR>
Keep an eye contact, read her body signs.<br><BR>
Other than that, keep a rhythm. You can speed up the rhythm, but you shouldn't<BR>
slow it down, or change it too often.<br><BR>
If she tells you to move harder, or faster, you better do what she<BR>
says. :)<br><BR>
And don't stop through her orgasm (if you do things right, and/or are<BR>
lucky :) )<br><BR>
She might feel like she is over stimulated, but she won't like it if<BR>
you stop.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
You can also try to build up an orgasm and then slow down the rhythm. <br><BR>
Slow down a bit.<br><BR>
Then build it up few more times, then let it explode :)<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Don't touch her clit with your fingers. Clit is too sensitive for that.<BR>
You can touch it over the clitoral hood.. Or move your fingers around<BR>
her clit. But never touch her clit directly with your<BR>
fingers.<br><BR>
You CAN touch it with your tongue, though. Gently, or you can flick it,<BR>
if you want :)<br><BR>
Don't go inside of her with your fingers or your penis until she is<BR>
wet. It would hurt her.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Remember to cuddle afterwards. Hold her gently. <br><BR>
DON'T turn back and fall asleep. That is the worst you can do.<br><BR>
Don't get up to do something. Don't turn the lights on, or stop the<BR>
music.<br><BR>
She will feel vulnerable after the event, and want you to hold her. DO<BR>
that. If you just get up and leave she will feel used and discarded.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
Ask her what she likes in sex. If she is to shy to answer, ask her to<BR>
hold your hand, and to squeeze when you do something she likes.<br><BR>
These are just general directions, be free to experiment. <b>You<BR>
should both try to have fun, and play, enjoy.</b> Play together with her.<BR>
Laugh, a lot. Explore.&nbsp;<br><BR>
With her consent, of course.<br><BR>
<br><BR>
And lastly, you shouldn't have sex with people you don't plan to have<BR>
(loving) relationship with. Sex creates bonds between people. They are<BR>
not easily broken.<br><p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
