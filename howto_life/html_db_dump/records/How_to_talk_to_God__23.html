<BR>
It is said in the Bible:<BR>
Matthew 7:7<BR>
"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Note: Sometimes the answer will come before you ask, sometimes later. Maybe even few days later.<BR>
The answer will come when you are ready to hear it.<BR>
