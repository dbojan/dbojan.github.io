No one has ever changed anything by worrying.<BR>
<BR>
-Breathe in, breathe out (streess)<BR>
Breathe in (peace, )<BR>
Breathe out (unpeace, stress )<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-In light<BR>
When under stress, imagine yourself swimming in the light, laughing. <BR>
In the ball of light. Or pool.<BR>
<BR>
-Remember who you are<BR>
Look yourself in the mirror. You are strong. And beautiful.<BR>
"Stop playing being a victim."<BR>
<BR>
-Stress simulator, defeating stress<BR>
Re-visualize stressful situations in your head until they are not longer stressful.<BR>
Or feared of. <BR>
Re-visualize them in your own private stress-less simulator. :)<BR>
Laughter, and choosing another point of view, might help...  :)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-Face your fear/cause of stress<BR>
Find the cause of the stress or fear.<BR>
What is the worst that could happen, anyway?<BR>
Don't be addicted to material things. You own them, they don't own you.<BR>
Other people? They are adults, they make their own choices in life.<BR>
<BR>
-You can solve the problem. Remove the cause for stresss.<BR>
Make the plan to solve the problem, and execute it.<BR>
That is all there is to it.<BR>
Create steps, then follow them one by one.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Otherwise, tension and stress, and frustration, and (unsolved) problems tend to build up, in your subconsciousness, to form an illness in your body organs. Like tiny knots of bad, stopped/blocked energy?<BR>
Like tension builds sometimes in your muscless. Then, you need a massage :)<BR>
So breathe it out. Also write it out (for example, in a form of journal, or just write it on the paper), or say it out (loud.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-Drink green tea, to detoxify your body.<BR>
-Remember to rince/brushe your teeth afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
-Here are some ways to relieve stress:<BR>
So when you are feeling down:<BR>
Gym, video games, running, box practice.<BR>
Sing, dance, laugh, love.<BR>
It helps if you have someone to love. A person or an animal, like a cat.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-If nothing else helps, think about changing your job/line of work.<BR>
It is not the end of the world. And your health is worth more than your job.<BR>
But, this has to be your decision, and it is often better to find a new job, and THEN to<BR>
quit the old one. :)<BR>
-Make a new rule. Do not think about work, when you are at home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-There is also option of digging a hole, and speaking your problems and frustration to the Earth, who will convert it to the positive energy.<BR>
And cover the hole.<BR>
<BR>
-Workout helps, too.<BR>
<BR>
-Women live longer because they talk about their problems.<BR>
Men don't.<BR>
<BR>
So before you go to sleep, talk to someone or speak outloud, about things<BR>
that might make you nervous.<BR>
You will feel lighter.<BR>
Release negative energy from you.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-To every problem, there is a solution. When you look back, you will think how silly of me to worry like that.<BR>
So try to skip to that part in time when the problem is solved.<BR>
Do not let your body get hurt by bad emotions. You need your body in this environment. Like deep sea divers need their diving suit.<BR>
Do not worry. Worrying has never changed anything.<BR>
Do not allow your body to get nervous. Just say: NO. <BR>
<BR>
-You cannot die. Your body can die, but your soul is eternal.<BR>
Dolphins know this. That is why they are so joyful.<BR>
<BR>
It is like if your car won't work any more. It does not mean the driver is gone.<BR>
<BR>
Everything that happens in this life is more like a video game. You get experience, and move on.<BR>
You cannot really be hurt, just like you cannot really be hurt while playing the video game.<BR>
It looks real, but that is the point of virtual reality. To make it look like it's real.<BR>
<BR>
So you have to think out of the running program, out of the running game. Out of the box.<BR>
To look beyond. Raise your eyes up, and see the beauty that surrounds you.<BR>
The point of this game is to experience what life is like.<BR>
Your emotions are not supposed to end your game, or hurt your body :).<BR>
<BR>
Remember always, especially when you have some problem, <BR>
That <BR>
- you will find a solution to the problem<BR>
- keep connection to your higher self. keep connection to the light.<BR>
- just as you are not your car, when you drive it, you are not your body. You are a spirit. Experiencing life. So do not worry.<BR>
Smile. Be happy :)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am talking about anger, anxiety, fear, worry.<BR>
Remember, "only love is real, everything else is an illusion". :) (David Icke)<BR>
<BR>
Don't worry, love instead. :)<BR>
<BR>
-Is it really that important, the thing you were so stressed about?<BR>
When you look back, is there anything that really was worth being stressed?<BR>
<BR>
-Did it help you were stressed back then? Do you think it would help now? No.<BR>
So do not worry.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-We are all one. You are part of the whole world. The whole world is part of you.<BR>
If you make a mistake it is not that bad. Nobody is perfect. Just do your best.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Note: You are doing this at your own responsibility.<BR>
