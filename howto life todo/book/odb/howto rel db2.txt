Click on "Data" tab.
"Data field"="CustomerID" (because we are showing index key from customers table, just choosing to display column named "phone" first.)

add Customers table 
(here we set display to show phone first instead of just company id.) 

field cell=Phone 
table cell=Customers 
visible=on 

column next to it 
field cell=CustomerID 
table cell=customers 
visible=on 

Make sure Phone is first, then CustomerID.

Save form. close. 


Add some phone numbers in "customers" table using "tables" tool.

When you open "Task" form again, you will have phones displayed too.

to disable search, click on "apply filter", which will turn it off.
