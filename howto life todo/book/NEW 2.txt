I've worked on loooads of transcripts. I did most of these:

* http://wiki.fsfe.org/Transcripts [fsfe.org]

The best technique I've found is to have mplayer play the audio at 60% normal speed and have a text editor (emacs is my preference) in another window, flick between them with alt-TAB and hit Space to start and pause mplayer.

To play an audio file at 60% normal speed:

mplayer -af scaletempo=scale=0.6 the_file.ogg

And then to check the transcript, change the 0.6 to 1.5 (or 2.0 for someone like Richard Stallman who speaks slowly and clearly).

I assigned F12 to skip back 5 seconds and F9 to pause/restart
