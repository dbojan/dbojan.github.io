men when they see boobies they are blinded.
what more?
10thign before you die?

what is the thing you fear most. Imagine if you could defeeat that fear.

if you could just replace your body like the old car.

maybe thye are just like us , meaybe they just want to be sfriends.

slow time

if they want something more, they will let you know.
you l feel they do it too.



let go of expectations on you, your demands on you.
