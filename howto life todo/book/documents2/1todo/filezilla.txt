this program has some seriuos design problems.
that is what, six panels open by default. you are scaring people away.
just copy wsftp old interface. or ftp explorer.

also that quick connect /open the site manager toolbars. 
they feel strangely uncomfortable.

also what is with sucessfull transfers count? do you expect people to keep count
of how many files they have transfered. just show message on failed transfer.

on the positive side panel rearengement is saved on exit, unlike previous versions.
I wish sites username and password is saved (encoded password) in current
dir ini file.
