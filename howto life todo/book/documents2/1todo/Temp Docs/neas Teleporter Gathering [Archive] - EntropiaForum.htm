13	Teleporters, (&#8220;<b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">tp</b>&#8221; for short)<br />
<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/Teleporter.jpg<br />
<br />
To activate the Teleporter just walk into it, stand close to the light and rightclick at it. Once activated (means you see it on your map as blue dot), you can teleport back to it from any other Teleporter.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the only option you have is to run to all the tps but 3 (Port Atlantis, New Oxford, and Treasure Island Castle) to activate them.<br />
<br />
It will save a lot of time if you collect all the tps, or at least those which are near the locations you want to hunt or mine.<br />
<br />
To teleport, walk into the <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">tp</b> and rightclick at it. The map will open. You select the <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">tp</b> at or near the location you want to go, click at teleport you arrive there in a few seconds (or minutes if the lag is high).<br />
If you want to teleport to the other continent (you can&#8217;t run there) walk into a <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">tp</b>, and click change continent choose one of the tps there, and teleport to it.<br />
<br />
This are the <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">tp</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#ff9999">coordinates</b> for Eudoria, with a way explanation. I suggest you follow that way, because you can find you at a stuck outpost very soon, if you don&#8217;t. If you have too much problems send me a message and I see what I can do to take you there.<br />
		<br />
Name	<br />
<b style="color:black;background-color:#ff9999">Coordinates</b>	<br />
X (increases by moving east)	       Y (increases by moving north)<br />
<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map1_263701.jpg<br />
Port Atlantis	           6055       8442<br />
Port Atlantis Mall (top level)	5859	8374<br />
Billy&#8217;s Spaceship Afterworld8127	10542<br />
Orthos West Mound	6379	12144<br />
Camp Phoenix	9790	10583<br />
Zychion Citadel	10850	9676<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map2.jpg<br />
East Scylla Mountains13812	9114<br />
now you head south east too the beach. Beware of atrax there, after some time you head north east to<br />
<br />
Twin Peaks	17032	8096<br />
<br />
Twin Peaks Mall (top level)	16814	8372<br />
now you run south, avoiding the armax until you are swimming, stay more or less near the coast, after you are close you head to<br />
<br />
Fort Troy	13353	3962<br />
from east Scylla now to	<br />
Jason Centre	 14454	10864<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
from phoenix or Zychion now to (beware the fishes in the lake)<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map3.jpg<br />
Limnidan District	12107	12070<br />
<br />
Fort Fury	11080	13230<br />
<br />
Fort Medusa	12634	13602<br />
<br />
Atlas Haven	 12388	15845<br />
Atlas Island North	12582	17214<br />
<br />
NEVER head north from here, after some time there comes a hard stucking outpost<br />
now you run south west, to the coast, follow it to <br />
Atlas Island South	10534	14934<br />
<br />
Tethy's Creek	10484	15933<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now head west, and a bit north if possible, if you are killed don&#8217;t care, it is quite easy to escape those outposts there, run to<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map4.jpg<br />
Hadesheim Outpost	7669	15970<br />
<br />
Hadesheim South 6910	16467<br />
<br />
Hadesheim Centre	7126	17092<br />
<br />
Hadesheim East 8080	17347<br />
Now it will be a bit critical, run north and a bit east, if you are killed and come to a outpost north of Hadesheim quite everything is alright, make it to the beach and head (swim mainly) to<br />
<br />
Cape Corinth	3330	21019<br />
then run and swim north east, the more north you reach the next island the better, after you reached it head to <br />
<br />
Fort Ithaca	9127	22353<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map5.jpg<br />
Fort Argus	15206	23532<br />
you can try a breaktrough to <br />
Camp Echidna	17950	19639<br />
but can also try it from pandora later<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map6.jpg<br />
again don&#8217;t run south from south from Argus, especially not south west, head to the north until you are in the ocean, and start swimming to<br />
<br />
Fort Zeus	 22466	27705<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map7.jpg<br />
North Space Base	24493	28912<br />
Next can be critical, try to reach the ocean in the east, then head south to<br />
<br />
Camp Caravan	 24014	23520<br />
swim south to	<br />
	<br />
Minopolis	25488	17486<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the direct way can be very hard, so you can also try to reach the ocean and swim south most of the way<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map8.jpg<br />
<br />
Nymphtown	24900	12416<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
from Atlas Haven to	<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map9.jpg<br />
Fort Ares 	14478	14399<br />
<br />
Aegis Mound 	14400	16187<br />
<br />
Chimera Canyons15595	16324<br />
the 2 most critical at the end	<br />
first Pandora, easiest from twin up the desert, or from Ares if you run west to the desert and then north <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">tp</b><br />
<br />
Fort Pandora	19650	15380<br />
from here you can another run for Echidna too</div></div><hr />

Amethera is bigger, and often you find strong creatures there, large areas in Amethera are even PvP zones<br />
<br />
start from Treasure Island Castle (or oxford, depends on what you like more)	<br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map_ame1.jpg<br />
Treasure Island Northern Shores	22973	26510<br />
<br />
from Treasure Island Castle	20679	24846<br />
<br />
Treasure Island City	18515	21859<br />
<br />
Genesis Amethere Headquarters16941	19927<br />
<br />
New Oxford	15603	19310<br />
<br />
Bilton Towers	14861	18928<br />
<br />
Wolverine Hope	21103	17121<br />
<br />
this way might be hard, you could also try from <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Nea's</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">place</b> later to<br />
Nate Valley	19899	8599<br />
<br />
Rei's Defense	20303	4604<br />
<br />
Sakura City	23226	5650<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From Nate Valley or Oxford, stay away from equus <br />
http://www.entropiaforum.com/gallery/files/2/8/5/4/tp_map_ame2.jpg<br />
<b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Nea's</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">Place</b>	12984	10598<br />
<br />
Omegaton West Habitat	10327	10682<br />
<br />
Memorial Island	7153	7553<br />
<br />
Oyster Isle	4024	9268<br />
I suggest you come from oyster isle, head as much south west as you can, and just when you&#8217;re closer to the island head east again, avoid being killed, especially being killed too much east<br />
<br />
Myrene Island	4537	3369<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
start New Oxford or Bilton towers, north west to		<br />

this way might be hard, you could also try fron <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Nea's</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">place</b> later<br />
<br />
<br />
From <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Nea's</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">place</b> might be even harder, as your run will take you quite close to the Berycled Stalkers of Argo land. :scared:</div></div><hr />

on my last &quot;<b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">tp</b> run&quot;, well actually it was more a contest, we made a little competion who arrives first in Nates then Sakura from starting point <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Nea's</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">place</b>.<br />
He told me had seen nothing on the way, and all i saw were 2 equus i could have walked around.<br />
<br />
but if you come from wolverine you have atrox land, atrax land, or merp land in your way, and thats harder, i just wanted to give 2 options, both can be hard, sometimes they aren't<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KapokWu</div><div class="date">12-23-2006, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice work and +rep, but y really should add the concept of revival <br />
areas to your instructions. I dunno how y could do it so people <br />
don't feel dizzy, add it as an alternative page or something. <br />
For example one easily ends to Chuck's Hideout  when <br />
trying to reach Billy's from PA ... <br />
see the map (http://www.saunalahti.fi/~pavone/PE/pe-map-snapshots/eudoria-revivals.html). <br />
<br />
So one should reach the spot 8200,9800  on the N side of the <br />
Blue Hill of the Atlantis Swamp, which is quite possible with a lucky mad dash. <br />
And y should add more instructions of where to go to avoid the difficult <br />
spots. So, more detailed routes please. Straight lines distract folks <br />
really to run along them... <br />
<br />
Also, make your maps like this one (http://www.saunalahti.fi/~pavone/PE/pe-eudoria-tprun2.jpg), but updated. Things have changed <br />
a little, but it would be nice if the reader really understands he has two <br />
choices: <br />
<br />
<br />
 Feel the heat and take risks and walk your walk through the mobs ....or...<br />
 Have a good book, set a rigth swimming direction, and brb 10-20 mins when possible. <br />
<br />
<br />
I consider these instructions  (http://www.saunalahti.fi/~pavone/PE/running-tps.html) little bit outdated on some parts, but <br />
otherwise good especially for mentors.<br />
<br />
If you somehow can combine your neat presentation style with the raw <br />
data on those resources, then it could help a lot of people. And you <br />
probably should have separate pages for &quot;risk-takers&quot; and &quot;swimmers&quot;. ;)<br />
<br />
And I am still working on that damn Amethera revival map, the job <br />
loaded me up so could not complete it this year. <br />
<br />
(This is not my entry to the contest, noticed it just now, it is <br />
a kind of push for Alice to improve her guide more.<br />
<br />
And hey: just in case EU gets a new noob wave in, add <br />
instructions of how to start from other cities (Atlas, Argus,<br />
Troy...) and how to use Treasure Isle as a meeting point <br />
if y and yr pall started form different places (these could <br />
be at a separate tutorial, Basics of the Basics :) ). <br />
<br />
That affects the organisatiion of the whole document: <br />
<br />
People start mainly at PA, but sometimes there is a week <br />
or month when they start from many other cities, and <br />
then everybody needs these tutorials, either to read them <br />
or to refer to them,</div></div><hr />

i thought about using the revival map indeed, but i had problems to get all the &quot;rival lines&quot; in the pic, was quite confusing, and i planned to make those smaller ones, and with that many lines noone would know where to ran too :D<br />
thats why i decided to make those maps on my own and combine it with ingame screenies of the maps (some copy and paste work, i can tell ya :D )<br />
i didn't dare to use bigger maps, that would have maybe looked a bit strange<br />
the ways are usually tried by myself, and i didn't have many problems, most are quite without mobs, of course if you run blind you won't make it :D<br />
atm im planning to comine my main guide with some maps on my site, what is my current kinda secret project, at least the look of it, there will be revival maps available for downloads<br />
the other reason why i haven't implemented it, those mini maps are small hints how to run, as long you don't use window mode or pe ass you can't take a real look at them anyway, i mainly wanted to give an impression on how to run, in the end this will differ for every runner anyway<br />
<br />
but i thank you for posting the map, mine is someone lost on HDD :silly2:<br />
<br />
if they start someone else, they could follow the way back i guess, i mean if i run from to billys to phoenix, the way back should work kinda similar<br />
<br />
but ill think about improving this, but it isnt my only entry, and i want to see the others finished before someone else has the same ideas or stuff like me<br />
gotta improve this later<br />
btw, to ame revival map, www.terraverdepe.com<br />
i think there is one without emerald lake</div></div><hr />

He told me had seen nothing on the way, and all i saw were 2 equus i could have walked around.<br />
<br />
but if you come from wolverine you have atrox land, atrax land, or merp land in your way, and thats harder, i just wanted to give 2 options, both can be hard, sometimes they aren't<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah. I misunderstood. <br />
<br />
Because the words were under Wolverine Hope, I thought you meant that you should try to get Wolverine from <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Nea's</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">Place</b>. Where in fact you were saying that you can get Nate Valley from Wolverine, but you might have a better chance from <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Nea's</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">Place</b>.<br />
<br />
After doing the run from Wolverine to Nate Valley a few months ago, I can certainly agree that the run from <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Nea's</b> <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">Place</b> to Nate Valley is much easier. I spent an hour or two trying to escape the atrox herd in the land area North of Nate when I tried to come in from that direction. :laugh:</div></div><hr />
