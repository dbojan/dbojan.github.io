  i actually get in-game emails and &quot;whispers&quot; from people trying to direct me to their websites that have the lowest prices on gold.  no matter what server. . . they have gold and even items or character accounts for sale (like lvl 60 characters with all-purple armor and stuff).<br /><br />one time somebody posted a thread at each and every single section of the <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">WoW</b> official forums advertising his website selling the cheapest prices of Gold.  within 30 minutes, all the threads were deleted, . . . and from what i understand, his account (forum and game) were banned because of <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">WoW</b> game policies concerning the selling of gold.<br /><br />it&#39;s crazy.  the last two times somebody sent me a &quot;whisper&quot; advertising their gold-selling website, i took a screenie of it and sent it to Blizzard along w/ a report.<br /><br />but heh, i see you can spend &#036;50 for 1,000gold, which when earned the legit way, would take me weeks (if not months) to save . . . . assuming i do absolutely <i>nothing else</i> except grind and farm, and sell sell sell on auction house.  but i&#39;d end up wanting to keep all my gold instead of handing it over for cash.  i probably wouldn&#39;t last very <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">long</b> w/ that job. . . ha&#33;<br /><br />anyhow, interesting information there.. . although i share grush&#39;s feelings on the matter.  but to each his own, though.<br /><br />when i first started <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">WoW</b>, things were more affordable at the auction house.  now everything is sky-high in price as we see more and more gold-farmers and game exploiters, and the in-game economy is screwed up b/c of this (on MY server, anyway).  lvl-20&#39;s are all running around w/ all blue gear and fiery-enchanted weapons, heh.<br /><br />the game has come a <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">long</b> way.

  That brings up the second reason why I won&#39;t play <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">WoW</b>.<br />One, it&#39;s Pay to play.<br />Two, the economy is far from beginner friendly now.<br /><br />Like I have to work much much harder from the start just becuase I am getting in the game late; I don&#39;t think so, especially when I am paying to play.<br /><br />It&#39;s sad really, from what I read and hear it&#39;s a great game, nad itl ooks cool.

  well, it&#39;s a matter of time vs. money.  How <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">long</b> does it take to <b style="color:black;background-color:#a0ffff">earn 1000 gold</b> in <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">WoW</b>?  Bender... you said weeks, if not months of regular game play... what would that translate to in Hours Played?<br /><br />Granted, I&#39;m only asking for a really rough estimate.<br /><br />But then again, considering how a TON of people will take any advantage they can in a game (IE cheating)... and how games are getting harder and harder to cheat in (modding FL, versus Modding <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">WoW</b> for example), if someone could go to work for an 8 hour night at a real job and earn &#036;50, and that can save them 300+ hours of gaming to get 1000 gold... I think we can see plainly why sites and farm organizations like these can stay in business.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure some people are getting into the game late, after their friends have all been singing the praises of the game... and they feel the peer pressure to catch up.<br /><br />Some other people (we know who they are) just need to be better than everyone else in one way or another, regardless if it is real or perceived.  So maybe, to them, it is better to have all the goodies hard work produces, without the hard work.<br /><br />You can&#39;t jack up the price of existing goods to compensate the excess amounts of money, for that only punishes those who aren&#39;t getting money illegally, right?<br /><br />I wonder if personalized money... gold electronically tagged with the ID of the person who dug it up, might be the solution.  It would all be behind the scenes.  In the game code.  You go out mining and grinding(???) and collect and generate your gold.  Then you spend it.  If YOUR Id doesn&#39;t match the ID tag on the gold, it is considered worthless.<br /><br />Ok, not the best solution, cuz you can&#39;t give the money away, and you can&#39;t go out robbing people for their gold.  BUt hey, it eliminates the current economic problem, right?

  between my mage and my paladin, i have about 650g.  it took me since march to acquire that, . . . BUT . . . the majority of that was earned in two months.  and i wasn&#39;t even seriously farming the whole time.  i average maybe 10 hrs of playtime per week, and maybe 1/4 of that was &quot;farming.&quot;  so we&#39;re looking at roughly 22-25hrs over two months for me to earn probably 400g while &quot;farming&quot;, and the other 250 was from miscellaneous stuff, like selling drops, DE materials, things like that while questing.<br /><br />how do i earn so much so fast?  well, on Hellscream server, . . . a stack of Un&#39;Goro Soil goes for 3-4g per stack of 10.  if you&#39;ve been to Un&#39;Goro, you&#39;ve noticed piles and piles of it everywhere.  also, my main is a miner, and i mine thorium veins.  occasionally, i&#39;ll get arcane crystals that sell for 18gold each on my server.  this morning, i logged in for 30 minutes. . . and i was fortunate enough to mine 3 arcane crystals, maybe 10 thorium bars, and probably 2 stacks of Un&#39;Goro soil.<br /><br />i will auction all that off tonight, . . . i&#39;ll probably make 8gold from teh Un&#39;Goro soil, 54g from the arcane crystals, and maybe 5gold for the 10 thorium bars. . . . . almost 70gold right there. . . . for 30 minutes of play.  (yes, finding 3 crystals in 30 minutes was lucky, but i tend to find 1 crystal quite often, typically every mining session i do in Un&#39;goro).<br /><br />last month, i won a greed roll for a purple shield called &quot;Green Tower&quot; dropped when we were in Maraudon . . . i sold in auction for 85gold.  i didn&#39;t keep it because, although it was a nice &quot;purple&quot; shield with great stats, it wasn&#39;t as good as my then-current shield Aegis Scarlet Commander (and the Aegis was only a &quot;blue&quot;. . . a step-down in rarity, but still more powerful than the Green Tower).<br /><br />i&#39;ve been pretty fortunate w/ my earnings. . . . and i sell EVERYTHING.  my mage gathers kingsblood and sells them for 4g per stack of 20.  i sell all my DE materials.  believe me, i&#39;m a friggen tight-wad in the game.  heh.<br /><br />@ SLA - i&#39;ve learned that the AH is your best friend. . . . sell EVERYTHING.  DE materials sell pretty well.   faction turn-in materials (like kingsblood, iron bars, and heavy leather, and Un&#39;goro soil) sell quite well.  gathering skills will earn you good money if you go out and get all that you can.  you can gather while questing, or just go to a great &quot;farming&quot; area and proceed.  mining is friggen uber in Un&#39;Goro Crater. . . . in fact, that&#39;s my favorite &quot;farming&quot; area when i want to mine to make money.  you get it all there, thorium ore, soil, arcane crystals, other crystals that sell for a little less, etc.  and what&#39;s best about it is that it doen&#39;st take very <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">long</b> to accumulate stuff there.  only drawback is that if you&#39;re not lvl 50+, it can be a hastle to farm around all those bad creatures out there.<br /><br />now, would i cash in &#036;50 to get 1000gold overnight to save myself from that tiem spent?  nope, because of the experience of it all, the expeience points gained, my mining and blacksmith skills continually to point-up.  (actually, my mining is now 300. . . hehe. . . my blacksmith is 296 now).  i sweat for everything i do and have. . . it&#39;s just the way i am.  i have an entire set of Imperial Plate Armor. . . made half of it myself . . . sweat and blood . . by myself.  bought the other half.  i&#39;m pretty attached to it (literally&#33;) although it&#39;s not the best set.  still, though. . .

  Sounds like the <b style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">Wow</b> ecconomy is simple an unregulated Global ecconomy. What if there were some forms of government(s) that had their own currencies; there would be more control, and more currencies.
