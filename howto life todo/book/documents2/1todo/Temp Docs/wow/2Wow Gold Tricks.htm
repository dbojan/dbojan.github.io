				<small>December 3rd, 2006 <!-- by Zuruk --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Shadowfang Keep is the best source for level 19 twink gear. These items sell for pretty high prices because rich high level players buy them for their low level &#8216;twink&#8217; characters so that they can dominate the low level battlegrounds. Pretty much any trash mob inside Shadowfang Keep can drop one of these items but the drop rates aren&#8217;t very high. Some people have estimated that on average you get one BoE blue item every five SFK runs.</p>
<p>Grinding these trash mobs (around level 20 elites) is really easy as a higher level character. Another way to profit from these twink items is to find newbies doing Shadowfang Keep runs who don&#8217;t realize how much these twink items can be worth.</p>
<p>Twink items dropped by SFK mobs:</p>
<p><strong>Assasin&#8217;s Blade</strong> is the best dagger for level 19 Rogues. With a Fiery or a Crusader enchant it also becomes a good dagger for level 20-29 twinks. This is a very high demand twink item which should easily sell for over 100 gold. If there are tons of Rogue twinks on your server it might sell for over 500 gold. On average you get one of these every 85 SFK runs.</p>
<p><strong>Shadowfang</strong> is the best level 19 one-handed sword which makes it another great Rogue twink weapon. Toughest guys want to have a Shadowfang in the main hand and a Assasin&#8217;s Blade in the offhand. On average you get one Shadowfang every 100 SFK runs.</p>
<p><strong>Night Reaver</strong> is a great two-handed axe for level 18 Warriors. Not worth as much as the Rogue twink gear above but might sell for something like 50+ gold if you&#8217;re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Witching Stave</strong> is great for level 17 Mages/Warlocks/Priests.</p>
<p><strong>Black Malice</strong> also drops in SFK. It&#8217;s a two-handed mace for level 16 Warriors. Doesn&#8217;t sell for nearly as much as any of the above items though.</p>
<p><strong>Guillotine Axe</strong> is a good level 18 axe for Hunters.

				<h2><a href="http://www.wowgoldtricks.com/p/limited-supply-recipes/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Profit by reselling limited supply recipes">Profit by reselling limited supply recipes</a></h2>
				<small>November 28th, 2006 <!-- by Zuruk --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Reselling limited supply recipes is one of the easiest ways to earn gold in World of Warcraft. This is especially true for newbies because doing it takes nothing more than knowledge on where to find the recipe and some time. Also when ever you travel nearby one of these limited recipe vendors it might be a good idea to check if he has the<br />
recipe on stock and buy the recipe. Then you should create a low level character on a city with an Auction House and mail your recipes/other sellable items to that character. That makes selling those item much faster than having to travel to a city every time you want to auction off something.</p>
<p>The reason why these items sell so well in the Auction House is that you only get them from one or two vendors and many people are too lazy to figure out who and where these vendors are. This is kind of proven by the fact that you can buy recipes from a vendor in a city and then auction them off in the AH of the same city for a big profit. Many people are also ready to pay so that they can save time by not having to do a trip to the vendor.</p>
<p>Btw, it makes no sense posting multiple copies of the same limited recipe at the same time in the AH. That will just drive the prices down so you&#8217;re better off selling your limited recipes one-by-one.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.wowgoldtricks.com/p/exploiting-other-peoples-raid-ids/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Exploiting other people&#8217;s raid-ids">Exploiting other people&#8217;s raid-ids</a></h2>
				<small>November 26th, 2006 <!-- by Zuruk --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There was a post on the official World of Warcraft forums earlier this month which talked about how you can use other people&#8217;s raid-ids for your own advantage without breaking any rules. Basically this enables guild A to enter guild B&#8217;s instance and skip content that guild B has already cleared. The post was later removed by Blizzard but I copy pasted it here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why use hacks to bypass AQ40 content when it is perfectly legal to just &#8220;steal&#8221; another guilds raid-id and use it for your own guilds benefit? And guess what? It is PERFECTLY legal to do so! It does not matter if the guild you &#8220;steal&#8221; from can or cannot complete that instance, its PERFECTLY legal to take it from them and do it yourself. Heck, you can even wipe the guild that you &#8220;steal&#8221; the raid-id&#8217;s from so that your guild can do it when time is beneficial to you. You can do all of this even WITHOUT asking the other guild for permission!</p>
<p>So why is this allowed and perfectly OK with server GM&#8217;s? Apparently to Blizzard, there is no such thing as &#8220;stealing&#8221; another guilds raid-id. If another guild happens to get your BWL, AQ40, or even Naxx id it is because you &#8220;gave&#8221; it to them. They do not believe that it is possible for a guild to &#8220;steal&#8221; the raid-id from another.</p>
<p>Well guess what? There are ways to do so and as long as this is legal, every guild on every server should use this to their advantage. Why clear up to Nef when you can just take another guilds instance that has it already cleared? Why wall hack and go through C&#8217;thun trash when you can just take it from a guild that has already done it for you?</p>
<p>Now you are wondering, well Itsy, how does my guild get into this fantastic time saving and legal offer? Well Bob, these are the many ways that you too can enjoy saving your guild loads of time on trash mobs!</p>
<p>1) The easiest method is to put moles into guilds that you want to &#8220;borrow&#8221; raid-id&#8217;s from. The mole joins a raid (willingly or through auto-invite) and voilah! You now have a perfectly nice and legal raid-id for your guild to use at your own pleasure.</p>
<p>2) Do a /who GuildIWantToStealFrom and find out what members are in the instance you want to &#8220;borrow&#8221; from. When those members are finished with the instance, you now have the chance to &#8220;borrow&#8221; this guilds raid id! Stand by the instance you want to &#8220;borrow&#8221; the raid-id from. Start inviting people that were in the raid to your party. If one declines, no worries, there are 39 other more that might join your party! So keep trying <img src='http://www.wowgoldtricks.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Eventually someone will join your party and when this happens quickly convert the party into a raid, make the person you invited into raid leader, then just ZONE IN! Voilah! A new raid-id for you to use that will save you hours of time each week!</p>
<p>3) If you want to &#8220;borrow&#8221; another guilds raid-id, another efficient and covert way are to run pug groups. Your chances of getting a raid-id increase with the size of the pug. So MC pugs are a great way to pick and choose ids from different guilds. But it doesn’t have to be MC as any pug group would work. Once you have the guy you want to &#8220;borrow&#8221; from, give him leader, zone into the instance you want, and once again be excited over the new raid-id you have just gained!</p>
<p>4) Another easy way is to abuse the kindness of people. You can easily get a BWL id by asking a person from the guild you want to &#8220;borrow&#8221; if its ok for them to use their BWL id to make flasks for their guild. Or ask someone if it’s ok for them to &#8220;borrow&#8221; their raid-id so that they can turn in their Armaments in AQ40. You’ll be surprised how many nice people (suckers) there are that will fall for this every time!</p>
<p>&#8212;END SARCASM&#8212;</p>
<p>You will wonder if any of this is true, well sadly it is all true and I will prove it to you with the screenshots I have attached. Screenshots with server GM&#8217;s saying that this is legal and nothing can be done about it.</p>
<p>You will wonder how I know all of this. Once again sadly, we were recently forced to deal with a situation against a guild with a horrible reputation, Decadence, which tried to do this to our guild and our AQ40 id. They have also done this to other guilds that are able to clear AQ40 and forcefully try to wipe guilds on C&#8217;thun attempts so that they can do it on their own time.</p>
<p>I honestly do not see a difference between Decadence and the guild that was recently banned for skipping AQ40 content. As a matter of fact, I find the methods used by Decadence to be viler as it infringes upon extreme harassment and affects people outside their own guild.</p>
<p>The reason we were able to stop Decadence from taking our C&#8217;thun kill because someone kind in their guild gave us a warning. When we foiled them from killing C&#8217;thun, they even threatened us over General Chat that they will steal our ID again and wipe us while we did the instance on the following week. Apparently this is still not grounds for harassment to the GM&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots I took from that night. Just a heads up, these screenshots are unedited and contain foul language.</p>
<p>This screenshot shows me ready and waiting for Decadence in front of C&#8217;thun.<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://runehammer.nrgservers.net/id/1.jpg">http://runehammer.nrgservers.net/id/1.jpg</a></p>
<p>This screenshot is after we wiped them trying C&#8217;thun. They were most certainly upset and you can see a few people belittling, threatening and telling us that they will &#8220;GET US&#8221; next week.<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://runehammer.nrgservers.net/id/2.jpg">http://runehammer.nrgservers.net/id/2.jpg</a></p>
<p>And finally this is a screenshot of the GM speaking to me telling me it’s OK to do what Decadence did to us. However, he did not like the idea of me posting this thread in the forums.<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://runehammer.nrgservers.net/id/3.jpg">http://runehammer.nrgservers.net/id/3.jpg</a></p>
<p>I hope the people at Blizzard put in some due diligence on this matter as there is now way of stopping it. Blizzard, if you would like more proof do contact me as I have a ton more.</p></blockquote>

				<h2><a href="http://www.wowgoldtricks.com/p/the-ultimate-gold-farming-spot-guide/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Ultimate Gold Farming Spot Guide">The Ultimate Gold Farming Spot Guide</a></h2>
				<small>November 24th, 2006 <!-- by Zuruk --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>This is a listing of 18 major gold farming locations in World of Warcraft. The listing is pretty much biased towards higher level zones simply because farming gold with a low level character isn&#8217;t very smart at all. It&#8217;s much faster to level up your character to level 60  on some crappy equipment and then start earning gold for all the stuff you want to buy.</p>
<p>Hopefully competition for these farming spots doesn&#8217;t increase too much after I publish this guide. <img src='http://www.wowgoldtricks.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Happy farming!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">WESTFALL</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">*********</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Defias Trappers</span><br />
(31,33)</p>
<p>In the Western shore of Westfall there is a small outpost that&#8217;s full of level 12-13 Defias Trappers. This is a great farming spot for low level and even high level players because these Trappers respawn super fast. These Trappers have a 35% drop rate for Linen Cloth so higher level can fill their backbag with Linen Cloth very quickly while lower level<br />
players can use this spot to grind for experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">STRANGLETHORN VALE</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">*******************</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Crystalvein Mine</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(44,45)</p>
<p>Crystalvein Mine is a cave to the East from Gurubashi Arena. Inside the cave you&#8217;ll find a lot of Ironjaw Basiliks which are level 43-44 mobs. You&#8217;ll be able to earn nice gold by selling all the vendor trash items these guys drop and grinding the corpses for Thick Leather and Heavy Leather.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">AZSHARA</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">********</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Highbornes</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(16,70)</p>
<p>Shadowsong Shire is on the left side of the road when you enter Azshara from Ashenvale. You&#8217;ll find some level 44-47 Highborne ghosts in there. They&#8217;re weak caster units so you&#8217;ll be able to farm them with ease for tons of mageweave, green drops and random chests.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">TANARIS<br />
*******</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Southsea Pirates</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(72,44)</p>
<p>There is a Southsea pirate town in Eastern Tanaris. The place is called Lost Rigger Cove and you can get there by going throught a tunnel. The place is full of level 43-45 pirates who should be very easy to farm on high levels. These guys drop some nice silver, Mageweave and Silk Cloth and also have a good drop rates for blue/purple items for such a low level mob which makes grinding them worthwhile.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">UN&#8217;GORO CRATER</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">**************</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Devilsaurs</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
Overall Un&#8217;Goro Crater is a great zone for skinners as there are so many kinds of skinnable mobs. It&#8217;s even better if you can kill Devilsaurs (level 52-55 elites) which can be skinned for Devilsaur Leather (Can sell for 50 gold per stack). Devilsaurs patrol<br />
6 different paths around Un&#8217;Goro and respawn relatively quickly which means that you can basically do circles around the crater killing Devilsaurs non-stop. Soloing Devilsaurs and Ironhide Devilsaurs shouldn&#8217;t be too hard on level 60. I&#8217;d recommend avoiding Tyrant Devilsaurs though because they have a nasty Fear ability.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">WINTERSPRING</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">************</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ice Thistle Yetis</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(67,40)</p>
<p>These guys are great for skinners. Not only do they drop nice vendor trash items, green items and sometimes blue/epics buy you can also skin them for Rugged Leather and Thick Leather which makes farming them greatly worthwhile. You&#8217;ll find tons of Ice Thistle Yetis from a large area North and East from Everlook.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Lake of Kel&#8217;Theril</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(53,42)</p>
<p>There are tons of level 54-55 ghosts around this lake. (Suffering/Anguished Highborne, etc.) These ghosts are pretty weak, drop 2-8 silver, a lot of green items and even have a tiny change of dropping epics. Random chests also spawn on this area. The lake is often heavily farmed but other than that it&#8217;s a great farming spot.</p>
<p>Also, a weekly water elemental invasion also takes place around the lake. It goes on until the boss, Princess Tempestria is slain. The elementals have a good drop rate for Essence of Water and the boss drops good very valuable blue items like Ace of Elementals. You&#8217;ve better group up for the boss though, soloing her isn&#8217;t impossible but still pretty hard to do.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Cobalt Dragons</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(57,50)</p>
<p>South East from the Lake of Kel&#8217;Theril there is a cave and around that cave there are a lot of Cobalt Dragons which are level 56-58 elites. The Cobalt Mageweavers/Scalebanes/Cobalt Wyrmkins on this area have a tiny change (Something like 1/1000) of dropping a a [Mature Blue Dragon Sinew]. Getting this item is hard work but you&#8217;ll be greatly rewarded if you succeed because Hunters need this items for a quest to get the epic quiver [Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina] and that&#8217;s why it can sell for hundreds of gold.</p>
<p>As a bonus Cobalt Mageweavers also have a pretty high 1.7% drop rate for [Recipe: Greater Arcane Protection Potion]. Guilds need this potion for AQ so you&#8217;ll be able to sell it for a pretty nice amount of gold if you can find the right buyer. Of course most elites also drop a lot of valuable green and blue items and Cobalt Dragons are no exception.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Frostmaul Giants</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
Frostmaul Giants are down in the Frostwhisper Gorge which is in South from Everlook. These guys are level 59-60 elites so they are pretty tough but they have a 2% drop rate for [Recipe: Greater Frost Protection Potion] which makes them worth farming for. The recipe can very well sell for something like 50 gold. As said already, these guys aren&#8217;t easy so it won&#8217;t hurt to be a Hunter or a Warlock when soloing them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Darkwhisper Gorge</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(60,75)</p>
<p>Darkwhisper Gorge is South from Everlook, all the way to bottom of the map of Winterspring. The demons (Hederine Slayer/Intiate) there are level 60 Elites so you&#8217;ve better group up before going there. What makes this place lucrative is that the demons have almost 1% drop rate for Eye of Shadow which is a very high value item (can sell for over 200 gold). You&#8217;ll also get tons of Runecloth, Felcloth and green items.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">FELWOOD</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">********</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Angerclaw Maulers</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(37,43)</p>
<p>Angerclaw Mauler bears are all over Felwood but there is a particularly good grinding spot for them at (37,43) which is North and a bit East from Bloodvenom Post (Horde camp). There are about 15 Angerclaw Maulers near that spot which can be killed relatively quickly for a lot of gray vendor trash drops. The trick is that when you combine those with<br />
the Thick Leather and Rugged Leather that can be skinned off these guys, you&#8217;ll earn gold surprisingly fast.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Jadefire Run</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(41,19)</p>
<p>Jadefire Run in Northern Felwood is a great place to farm tons of Runecloth and some Felcloth which is very valuable. The mobs on that area are level 52-53 Satyrs (Jadefire Betrayer/Trickster/etc) which are pretty easy to kill. This is a great farming spot as long as there isn&#8217;t too much competition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">WESTERN PLAGUELANDS</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">********************</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Felstone field</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(36,57)</p>
<p>Felstone field is first of the fields when you come from Bulwark. The great thing about this place is that there are tons of weak undead mobs who drop a lot of Runecloth. The respawn rate is also high so you won&#8217;t have any downtime unless there are other farmers competing with you.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Hearthglen</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(45,16)</p>
<p>Hearhglen is the Scarlet city in Northern Western Plaguelands. There are relatively easy to kill level 53-56 Elites (Scarlet Priest/Sentinel/Paladin/etc) all over Hearthglen. These guys have a high drop rate for Runecloth but what really makes them worth farming are the misc green/blue/epic items they sometimes drop.</p>
<p>There is also a tower (55,25) which you&#8217;ll pass on your way to Hearthglen. The tower is usually heavily farmed for [Formula: Enchant Weapon - Crusader] because Scarlet Spellbinder is the only unit in the game to drop that formula and there are 7 of those in the tower. This formula is very valuable and can sell for 200+ gold. I&#8217;d recommend anyone who ever gets a change to farm these guys without competition to do so.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Decaying Horrors and Rotting Behemoths</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
You&#8217;ll find Decaying Horrors and Rotting Behemoths near and inside The Weeping Cave in Eastern part of WPL. These are just regular level 55-57 mobs with a high drop rate for [Recipe: Greater Nature Protection Potion]. You get one recipe for about ever 100 kills and it can sell for as much as 100 gold so this looks like a pretty good deal to me.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">EASTERN PLAGUELANDS</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">*******************</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Mossflayer Zombies</span><br style="font-weight: bold" />(28,85)</p>
<p>Mossflayer Zombies reside in The Undercroft which is in the Southwestern corner of EPL. These guys drop are nothing too special except for being weak, respawning quickly and dropping a lot of silver and Runecloth. This is a good place to farm if there is too much competition over the other farming spots.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Plaguebats</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
You&#8217;ll have no problem finding Plaguebats. They&#8217;re all over the Southern part of EPL. Farming these guys is worth it especially during the Darkmoon Faire because Plaguebats have a high drop rate for Evil Bat Eyes which are required for a Darkmoon Faire quest. On some cases Evil Bat Eyes can sell for as much as 2 gold a piece. Of course you&#8217;ll also make a lot of gold selling all the vendor trash items and skinning the corpses of these guys.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Larval Acids</span><br style="font-weight: bold" /><br />
Carrion Grubs and Carrion Devourers are also the kind of mobs you&#8217;ll see all over the place in EPL. These guys have a high drop rate for Larval Acid which can sell for as much as 7 gold so killing all the Carrion mobs you encounter might not be a bad idea.

				<small>November 22nd, 2006 <!-- by Zuruk --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>For those who didn&#8217;t know, Fizzwidget ShoppingList is an AddOn that makes it easy to keep track of the items you are looking to buy. It integrates with Auctioneer enabling you to very easily notice when one or more of the items are available in your Auction House.</p>
<p>Below I have listed some rare items you should have on your ShoppingList. Usually you don&#8217;t want to buy rare blue or purple items just to resell them because AH listing fees for these items are expensive and selling them for a good price may be hard. These items are an exception because should be a high demand for these items on just about any server.</p>
<p>These are the high demand rare items you want to have on your ShoppingList:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elemental Attuned Blade (worth hundreds of gold)</li>
<li>Antenna of Invigoration (worth hundreds of gold)</li>
<li>Pendulum of Doom</li>
<li>Assassin&#8217;s Blade</li>
<li>Shadowfang</li>
<li>Miner&#8217;s Hat of the Deep</li>
<li>Expert Goldminer&#8217;s Helmet</li>
<li>Shovelphlange&#8217;s Mining Axe</li>
<li>The Jackhammer</li>
<li>Unearthed Bands of Agility, Power, Money, etc..</li>
<li>Petrospill Leggings</li>
<li>Mantle of Thieves</li>
<li>Flintrock Shoulders</li>
<li>Wolfclaw Gloves</li>
<li>Hotshot Pilot&#8217;s Gloves</li>
<li>Mechbuilder&#8217;s Overalls</li>
<li>Maiden&#8217;s Circle</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the good buying price for these items varies item by item and server by server so you shouldn&#8217;t rush to buy any of them on the first sight. Listing fees for these items are high so you don&#8217;t want to relist them multiple times at a too expensive price. As a rule of thumb, if you can get any of these items for something like 30 gold, it should be a good price.

					<p>There is a nice little AddOn called <a href="http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=3446">AuditorFu</a> that anyone concerned about their spendings in World of Warcraft should use. This AddOn simply tracks all your incomes and expenses on multiple parts of the game like loot, vendors, quests, trades, mails, auctions, training, flights and repairs. Very useful, at least if you care about your gold usage at all.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>1.) Put your non-combat pet into your second backbag slot</p>
<p>2.) Assign the following macro to a button:</p>

				<small>November 21st, 2006 <!-- by Zuruk --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>This is a pretty cool and easy to do trick that will get patched soon for sure. It enables a player to freely control a flying mount. You can&#8217;t really fly with it though. It just hovers a few feet above the ground.</p>
<p>This is how its done: You need to send your pet (required for this) to attack a mob near a flight master and talk to the flight master before your pet actually reaches it&#8217;s target. If you can pick a flight destination quickly enough, you&#8217;ll get a flying mount which you can control freely.</p>
<p>Note that some mobs need to be pretty close to the flight master for this to work and in some cases you might need to use speed buffs to be quick enough. Good locations with mobs close to flight master are at places like Zoram Strand, Tarren Mill, Kargath, Grom&#8217;Gol, Westfall and Gadgetzan.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s always nice to see people soloing places which they were supposed to group up for buy the creators. Hunter vs. World is a series of videos of someone soloing high level instances as a Hunter and going at just about anything that you can do your own. Much of what appers on these videos has been nerfed by Blizzard already, so you might be better not to try these tricks at home.</p>
