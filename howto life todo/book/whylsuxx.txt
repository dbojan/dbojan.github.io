1.portablity
Windows:
Program will most likely work in win 95/98/me/w2000/xp
there is no linux binary compatibility or gcc binary compatibilty

2. easy download & install
win:
download, start setup exe. press next next next

most people use source, not because they love it, but because
it is the most reliable way the program will work.
apt, Yum?. Only pcbsd seems to understand: one file download
one program. no matter how big.


3.easy install drivers
win
insert cd press next next next.
linux:
recompile kernel, try modprobe (requres knowledge of chip maker)

4.
Program usability: 
kompare user interface in K-mail and Outlook express,
or k-mail and THunderbird.
Overcrowded.

Or konqueror and windows explorer. Three configure items in
settings menu? 9 Menus?
Extra side icons? How do you expect people to figoure anything in
this mess.




Gnome: In dialog you can have what 3 recent dirs or something stupid
like that. Inverse yes/no buttons. What are important changes in 
every-week-new version. Although are there improvements in KDE?

Gnome: icons take too much space. As a result desktop is unusable
in 800x600 res. in which I can use win2000 just fine. This is less
noticable in Kde. Only if you take big fonts.




5. Why can't I use 8 pixels font in desktop In Linux. It suxx in 
Linux, bit works fine in win.


6. You cannot create shortcut by draging file in the same folder in
konqueror. Beacuse you frag file with wrong mouse key.

7. you cant get konq to open html always in new window.
not in the same (file browser)
That's why most people set html files to open with firefox or opera.




No amount of pretty icons, win decorations or styles
will change usability.

look and fee. Icons=look. program installation, drivers, games, ein explorer = feel.
no amount look can make up for feel.
