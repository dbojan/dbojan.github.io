here is the procedure:
-record your movement using gps.(record gps tracks)
-write down the names of the streets you pass
-upload data to the pc
-convert tracks to openstreetmap file type
-draw strets based on your gps traces and info on street names you wrote down.












RECORD GPS TRACKS:

Using gpsviewer.exe:
  If you have pna device with windows ce 5 you can use gpsviewer.exe
  It is in windows dir, and there is usually link in /my device to it.
  -start gpsviewer.exe.
  -wait for "gga" flag to turn green. (wait for sattelites.)
  -select log to sd.
  -click on "off" to start
  note:
  -each time you start gpsviewer it contionues to write to the current nmea.log file.
  You should rename original file to nmea1.log or nmea2.log if you want to have separate files.

  It takes around 250kb file for 5 minutes of recording.



Using Igo8 software:
  start igo8
  in IGO: 
   -settings/track log/update interval=1sec,enable auto save=off, max track database size=no limit
   -settings/navigation/keep position on road=off (important! don't forget this, or your log will be of already included maps.)
   (back to main menu "title: navigation menu")
   -manage/track logs/record
   -you can go to map now. back/back/map
   (you can choose to display tracks on map or not, it is not important, you can see where you have been.)






WRITE DOWN NAMES OF THE STREETS:

You should use a paper, voice recorder or camera to record street names. You can record points of interest (POI) if you want.
1st way: to draw a map on paper with name of the streets.

2nd way:If you use "gps locator" program you can see time (UTC), and write time and place like this:
12:15.17 Hill street
12:20:54 Valley street ... and so on.

You can view time of each point in merkaartor: http://www.merkaartor.org/
You can also convert track to kml and open it in google earth. 

You can also record POIs this way.
If you dont have time displayed in program, you can use digital watch and write down time, in seconds. 
Make sure watch is synchronized with GPS time.

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_techniques


Drive a car, or ride a bike or walk with gps device turned on. And write down street names.



UPLOAD DATA TO PC:


GpsViewer:

Transfer track to PC:
copy nmea.log to pc with USB cable (You'll need ActiveSync on xp), or by using SDcard reader.


Igo:

copy tracks  files from SDMMC\igo\save\tracks dir  to pc, with USB cable (You'll need ActiveSync on xp), or by using SDcard reader.
(If you want to use Igo for navigation later, you should set "keep position on road"=on)




CONVERT TRACKS



GpsViewer:

-download gpsbabel from http://www.gpsbabel.org/
-unzip it. start GPSBabelGUI.exe

-set input format=NMEA 0183 sentences
-click on icon, (paper) , in second row to select input file
-set output format=GPX XML (.gpx)
-click on icon, (paper and red arrow), in forth row to select destination file.
-click on "let's go" button.




Igo8:

-download gpsbabel from http://www.gpsbabel.org/
-unzip it. start GPSBabelGUI.exe

-set input format=IGO8 .trk,
-click on icon, (paper) , in second row to select input file
-set output format=GPX XML (.gpx)
-click on icon, (paper and red arrow), in forth row to select destination file.
-click on "let's go" button.



You can create bat file, put it in gpsbabel dir, and drag and drop single file on it
to convert igo track to kml and gpx.

igo--kml_gpx.bat:

cd %~dp0
gpsbabel.exe -p "" -w -i igo8 -f %1 -o kml -F %1.kml
gpsbabel.exe -p "" -w -i igo8 -f %1 -o gpx -F %1.gpx
pause


nmea--kml_gpx.bat:

cd %~dp0
gpsbabel.exe -p "" -w -i nmea -f %1 -o kml -F %1.kml
gpsbabel.exe -p "" -w -i nmea -f %1 -o gpx -F %1.gpx
pause


DRAW STREETS


-create account on www.openstreetmap.org

-login to openstreetmap.org
-gps traces/upload. (set visibility=public), wait.
-see only your traces. 
-edit. (with save option)
-save when done.

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch = you can also see video tutorial here. important part starts around minute 9.
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features = you can see here what map features are available here.


-click one to add a node (point). click next to it to connect to another. double click or shift + click to end and start another line.
-shift + click to add another node to existing line.
-When you select node it is marked yellow. you can delete it by clicking "del" key.
-You can separate roads by clicking on scissors icon, lower left part of the screen.

note on copyright.:
you can use yahoo aerial imagery.
you cannot use google earth to trace map.
You can view your tracks in google earth:
-Use GPSBabelGUI.exe to convert track to "Google Earth (Keyhole) Markup Language (.kml)"
In google earth: file/open kml file. 


You can use OpenStreetMapLayer.kmz from http://www.markus-bader.de/?p=14 to view osm data in google earth.
Double click on kmz file.

You can use slider between "places" and "layers" to change opacity.






CREATING PATHS IN GOOGLE EARTH AND USING IT IN GPS DEVICE


-click on add path in GE
-draw a path (left click to add node, righ click to delete. or del key. move with arrows.)
-when finished enter name, description, color.
-right click on it in "places", "save place as", enter name, "save as type"=kml
-use gpsbabelgui-2 to convert "Google Earth (Keyhole) Markup Language (.kml)" to igo8.trk.
-copy it to \SDMMC\iGO8\save\TRACKS
-start igo
-in igo: manage/track logs
-click on your track. select color. 
-go back to map
-click on 2d view to view it (2d grid in upper right corner)



You can use OpenStreetMapLayer.kmz from http://www.markus-bader.de/?p=14 to view osm data in google earth.
Double click on kmz file.


You can create bat file for converting files. Save content between two --- lines as "nmea_kml-gpx.bat"
Put it in gps babel dir. Drag and drop file on it.

This one will convert 1 file in kml format to igo:

---
cd %~dp0
gpsbabel.exe -p "" -w -i kml -f %1 -o igo8 -F %1.trk
pause
---






NOTE:



using garmin for mapping:
I havent made this work yet:
tools/settings/map/show location=at gps location

To record track.
-tools/manage my data/tracks/options/wrap when full.
-save active track when done
-edit/rename it to something recognizable

Transfer track to PC:

on PC:
install active sync on PC (needed for xp, vista and windows 7 already has it)
install mapsource, (unzip, start main.msi, then setup exe)
install some map from http://openmaps.eu/dlmap/%252Fimg?sort=asc&order=Country if you do not have any maps.

Start mapsource
-transfer/recive from device (or click on icon of device with arrow)
-Select garmin mobilext
-click on tracks.
-file/save as TYPE: gps exchange format *.gpx. (select type *.gpx and enter some name, like first.gpx)
NOTE: does not work.

You can use itnconv to convert gpx file to kml, and display it in google earth, but openstreetmap wont accept gpx 
file from  garmin->itconv->gpx.

(Dont forget to set show location to road later, when using garmin for navigation.)
