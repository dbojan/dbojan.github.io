Mio_Moov_Unlock.zip 356 kb needed.


i could get to control panel.
however 

on another device created dir: "\My Flash Disk\Program Files\"
create shortcut to it. in winexplorer select dir. click on "file/ send to desktop/create shortcut.
create dir on sdcard "MioMap". in it put file manager and operations.dll file. Rename FileManCE.exe to AppStartupSec.exe



so i started control panel.
go to desktop settings. (file/open).

click on browse. go to "my flash disk". create new folder. drag and drop "mioman" folder to "new folder"
go back to storage card. move mioman dir to SHORTCUT, which is pointing to  "\My Flash Disk\Program Files\".
reset device.


file manager should be started.
since I have renamed miomap to miomap-old in the begining, I cut all the files from the bad Miomap folder
moved them to some other new_folder.
then I cut all files from miomap-old and paste them in the miomap folder. reset.

other option you could try is try to turn it off and on repeatedly, in hope it will randomly change to
system default settings. (40-50 times). this might damage device?
