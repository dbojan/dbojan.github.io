Hmmm... Well, first things first.
Could you edit the boot.local to its original state? Live cds, etc... everything ok?

There are different approaches to what you might want to do to fix this. That's the nice thing about linux. I'll tell you what I did to insert my scripts in the boot process, but there can be other - even more efficient - ways to do the same thing.

1. Create a shell script to run the command you need:

- Open your text editor of choice and write

#! /bin/sh

# Command to up the wireless, by crazibri jun-2004 (or some header like this)

command

# Additionally, you may want to put a line that creates an empty file here, just to ease the
# verification of success. This file will be created with 0 bytes and owner root/root. Then you
# can remove it, no problem. If you wish not to put it, remove both this comment and the
# command.

touch /home/crazibri/wireless-ok

# Also optional

echo "Wireless done!"

EOF

- Save it as root/root in /etc/init.d

- Give it execute permission, by clicking in the "execute" bit in the properties dialog in a graphical env.

2. Now, open yast2 > system > Runlevel editor. Choose expert mode.

You'll see all the scripts listed there, and also the one you just created. Now, all you have to do is set it to run at, say, level 5 (which is multiuser/graphical env). In this point it comes up the doubt about the correct point to up the wireless. I guess runlevel 5 is a safe mode to operate.
You can also test if suse can run the script well, by trying to run now, with the Enable button.

After all this, just save and reboot.

Post again if you get stuck.
