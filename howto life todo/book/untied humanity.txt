United Humanity.

There should be no money. People should have enough to live.

All working able should work job they like, 6 hrs/day, half a year 
otherwise they would have minimum to live.

Humanity should be united. there should be not competitive sports
(football, athletics...)

People should think of everyone as their brothers and sisters and
treat thel like they would thier own brother and sister.

Greed for money comes from fear of not having enough.
If everyone is guaranteed to have enough, ther will be no fear, hence
no greed.

Money from sport and from army should be transfered to cure poverty and
hunger, and give people means to survival.

On planet earth there should be only one official language. There would 
be no need for interpreters. 

Violent content should be removed from movies, music, and video games.

It was tried before, but without proper supervision, human factor made it
unsucessfull. If someone could choose between himself and someone other, ono
always chose himself. Human race has not evolved enough.

Right now power hungry individuals fight decrease of global warning, polution
