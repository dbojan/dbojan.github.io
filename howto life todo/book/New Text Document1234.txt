You can't be afraid if there is nothing to lose. And you cant lose your soul. Everything else is temporary. An illusion.
But you should make at least smart choices. E.g. dont kill yourself, finish school, etc.

how to be in shape and to keep body/mass index
(how to lose excess weight)

eat regulary. every 4 hours.
practice at least twice a week, 15 min each. look up 5 tibethans exercise. you can skip/skim the 
firs one if your knee is giving you problems.
dont eat sugar in candies. try not to eat especially any mass produced kandy.
sugar is like drug. the more you eat it the more your body wants it.
instead eat peanut, baked without sugar.
nuts, hasels, almonds, (dried) grapes, or practically any other fruit in pauses between meals.

when you eat regulary, your body things there is no crysis, there is enough food, I do not need to make supplies (fat).
so as long as you eat regualry you shouldn ot gain fat.

if you skip dinner, or eat sometimes every 6 or 8 hours, your body thinks, there is shortage of food! I better make some
supplies. Hence the fat.
So don't skip meals. dont skip dinner. in the evening (before going to bed) eat reasonably. If you are houngry, or if 
4 hours have passed since the last meal. 4 hours is approximate time, it might be different with you.
eat something light, or a fruit. Eat when you are hungry.
Eat till you are 80% full? eat slowy chewing properly if you can. food wont goo away. make pauses while eating. thats ok too.
remember when you were kids? :)

When you were kid you had to go to he shool by foot (in most countries), you had phys. ed, you played basketball
with your friends. when you finish school/college, you get a job, a CAR, and stop going anywhere by foot.
so you have no physical exercise. Stop going everywhere by a car. Walk a little. It will not (probably kill you.)

how to get rid of the acne on your back. if you have to drive in the car to the work try buying beaded suit for the car.
Or lover your seat and try not to lean your back n the seat. Try not to sleep on your back.
Wash up/ shower when you get beck from work, dry up, wear clean t-shirt or wahtever.

face. dont touch with your hands, especially (sweatty palms.). if you feel prickling, wash it up with soap, wthen water
then dry it with clean towel.
if you have acne wait till middle part is white.
wash your hands with water or soap if they are swaety or greasy. same thing with the part othe face with the acne.
squish it out .wash face, hands with water. use toalet paper or paper hankerchifs to remove wetness fromthe face acne,
(every few seconds )in the next several minutes. but use clean & dry t. (new or part of) paper every time.

dont squish acne if you are not near water (while traveling in car). do not touch squished acnae with your bare hands immideatly after. dry it with
paper towel/hankerchiefs.
dont touch your face if it is dirty, if you cant wash it, dont touch it at all. you'll only make things worse.

if you have long face that fall on your face, esp. while sleeping, consider cutting it short while in puberty :(,
or keeping it off your face, also while sleeping. or just keep it short fot few few moths, to see if it helps.

husbands, your wives will love you more if you came home at 5 pm.
than if you stay at work 2 more hours, to finish.

you might finish the job, but you will LOSE your wife. And kids.\
men are driven by achievements. women are different. they need human warmth. hug, a kiss. some tenderness.
affection. show your wife some affection. take her our. compliment her look.
make some effort, do something for her. SHOW HER you care.

DONT stay all night at work killing yourself, trying to finish.
it's ...killing her too.

the thing parents should say to the kids: I love you no matter what you do.
Whether you fail or succed, my love wont go away.

Once upon a time The Earth was green and beautiful. It was entrusted to humans to use it wisely together with all living things.

Over time humans developed advanced technology using up the Earth’s natural resources. Humans lost their connection with the Earth. Caring only for their selfish interests, they didn’t notice the injuries that they had inflicted upon the Earth.

Climate change became the Earth’s scream for help. But nobody heard.
