BOSS IS ALWAYS RIGHT.
If he is not right dont say "You are wrong". Say "I am not sure".

Never say "I can not do that", or "I will not do that",
Say But if I do that, then ...., or something.

Be carefull when choosing between boss and other workers. Try to remain ignorant/uninvolved.

Dont ever say "I am 100% sure". Say "I think", or "I believe".
