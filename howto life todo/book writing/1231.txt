make her feel sexy. tell her that. let her know that.
a lot of women are insecure about their looks. With all the magazines, hardly any women thinks she is perfect.
Men don't read women's magazine so they don't know this stuff.
They look at woman and think. Nice tits. Great legs.
Women look at the same girl and think: She's got celulite. Her hair's got split ends.
Most men don't even know what these terms mean.
So, reasure her. Tell her she looks good. Some women get worried after some time in a relationship.
They worry if their sweetheart still loves them. If he still thinks they are sexy, and good looking,
and pretty.
Cause every year there are some new 18-year olds, who are aware of their devastatingly good look.



tell her she looks amazing. Tell her this, if not all the time, then from time to time.
For women, jealousy is the proof of love. If you are not jealous at other men checking her, you do not love her. That is what she thinks.
They need to feel desired.


So after she washes her hair, finishes her make-up after half an hour, and carefully picks up a dress, and maching earrings, bag and shoes,
tell her how great she looks.
Or you might lose her.
