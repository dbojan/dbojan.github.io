stress simulator in your head till you feel stress no more

other people don't exist. you do not need to worry what they will think of you, or about you.

picture the worst case scenario if you dont do something for your boss/on work. or if you make some
mistake. it is not so bad, is it? :)

the thing we are most afraid is the fear. something unknown, unseen, without shape or form.
the minute we see it , find out what it is, we are not scared anymore. 
or at least as much :)

the thing you are worried now, will be meaningless in a few days, or weeks.
don't believe me? think about the things you were worried about few days or weeks ago?
pretty meaningless, aren't they?
Not all perhaps, but most, anyway. :)

start a day with some pleasant memory recalled in your head. or real. does not matter.
something that ewokes pleasant, nice feelings. Love perhaps? :), or your loved ones.
something that will make you feel good for the rest of the day.
end the day with it too. for the night :)
(from the book "Anastasia" , By Vladimir Megre.)



do you feel stomachakes in the morning? if you do, do they only come in the workdays?
if you do not, that is even better. :)
No stress for you, my friend :)
