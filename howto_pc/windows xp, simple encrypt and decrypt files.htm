Drag and drop file on ccrypt.exe to encrypt.
Drag and drop file on decrypt.bat to decrypt.

I did not make ccrypt.exe.

You might need <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> to unzip the file.
There is also a <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable">portable version of 7-zip</a>, which does not need installing.
