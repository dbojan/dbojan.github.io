<pre>
backup using linux, howto backup (windows) files using tar, on the same partition


If there is only one partition in the computer:
cd /mnt/sda1 (move to the partition with the windows data)
tar cvf backup.tar --exclude=/mnt/sda1/backup.tar *  (create backup of all the files, except backup.tar)

(you can see partion names with "mount" or "fdisk -l", or "sudo fdisk -l")




If you have two partitions in the computer:
cd /mnt/sda1 (move to the partition with the windows data)
tar cvf /mnt/sda2/backup.tar * (create backup of all the files. Backup file will be on another partition)
