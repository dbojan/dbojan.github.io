How to add chapter marks to audio books, using opus codec

The kind of chapter information we want to add to .ogg and .opus files is called 'ogg chapter extension'
More info on the format itself is here: https://wiki.xiph.org/Chapter_Extension

Note: This tutorial audio part of files using opus codec. 
If you wish to use different codec, instead of "-c:a opus -b:a 16k", use "-c:a copy" to copy audio, or "-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 64k" to encode using a different codec. 

(Changing output extension to .mp3 also helps. Haven't tried that one when adding chapter marks. It may not leave chapter marks in the file.)



Using FFMPEG to create...:

MKA container (easiest one to create):


-First, extract cover image from m4b audio book to file d:\book.jpg (if there is one inside the m4b file.) Or download it from the web if available.
ffmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b  -c copy d:\book.jpg

"-c copy" says to copy stream without reencoding. If file is not in jpg, dont use "-c copy". 
You may open file in mpc-hc, or in vlc, or running ffmprobe -i d:\book.m4b, to see what format cover image is in.


-Next, to create .mka file with chapters using FFMPEG, following command is used:
ffmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b   -attach d:\book.jpg -metadata:s mimetype="image/jpeg"  -metadata:s filename="book-cover.jpg"  -c:a opus -b:a 16k  "D:\book_with_chapters.mka"

"-i D:\book.m4b" means source of audio is "D:\book.m4b"
"-attach d:\book.jpg -metadata:s mimetype="image/jpeg"" means attach image  (optional)
"-metadata:s filename="book-cover.jpg"" is the name under which it will be added to the output file. (optional)
"-c:a opus -b:a 16k" is audio codec and type. Audio is encoded using opus codec, if you do not wish to change audio codec, use "-c:a copy" instead of "-c:a opus -b:a 16k")

You can put "book.jpg"  or "anything.jpg" instead of "book-cover.jpg". Here is changed to "book-cover.jpg" for clarity. 
It signifies the filename that will be displayed in file properties, when playing the file with mpc-hc, or vlc.
Part "-attach ... book-cover.jpg" is optional. You can create audio book without cover, if you wish.

In this example, metadata, which includes title, artist, chapter info, and such, is copied directly from book.m4b. 
Cover image is added using the command before that. 

This copying of textual meta information, from m4b file,  only works for mka file as output, not for ogg or opus.


NOTE:
Say you have m4b file with cover image, and you wish to convert it to mkv format. Now, mkv container can contain video too, unlike mka container.
If you use the command:
ffmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b   -attach d:\book.jpg -metadata:s mimetype="image/jpeg"  -metadata:s filename="book-cover.jpg"  -c:a opus -b:a 16k  "D:\book_with_chapters.mka"
it will encode cover image as video in the output file, which is not good.
Add "-map 0:a" to the command line, which says: from the first file (0), take audio stream only (a). Example:
ffmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b   -attach d:\book.jpg -metadata:s mimetype="image/jpeg"  -metadata:s filename="book-cover.jpg"  -map 0:a -c:a opus -b:a 16k  "D:\book_with_chapters.mkv"
Which will copy audio only from the first file.
You can also add "-map 0:s" which will copy subtitle too. Example with both:
ffmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b   -attach d:\book.jpg -metadata:s mimetype="image/jpeg"  -metadata:s filename="book-cover.jpg"  -map 0:a -map 0:s -c:a opus -b:a 16k  "D:\book_with_chapters.mkv"
I believe cover image has to be added as attachment, and cannot be encoded from original file directly. This might be incorrect.








OPUS container:
-To create .opus file with chapters, following command is used
(opus codec is inside, naturally):
fmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b -i D:\metadata.txt -map_metadata 1 -c:a opus -b:a 16k "D:\book_with_chapters.opus"


OGA (ogg audio) container with Opus codec inside:

-To create .oga file with chapters, replace extension of the output file with ".oga". Otherwise command is the same as the one for opus file, ffmpeg does the rest:
fmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b -i D:\metadata.txt -map_metadata 1 -c:a opus -b:a 16k "D:\book_with_chapters.oga" 

"-i D:\book.m4b" means source of audio is "D:\book.m4b"
"-map_metadata 1" says use metadata from the second file (D:\metadata.txt)
"-c:a opus -b:a 16k" is audio codec and type. Audio is encoded using opus codec.

Format of metadata.txt is:
-Header is a ';FFMETADATA' string, followed by a version number (now 1).
(from https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#Metadata-1)
-Then comes metadata of the form 'key=value' 
Don't add 'encoder' tag in the txt file, as it tends to confuse ffmpeg, and move last key up.

--file begins here--
;FFMETADATA1
title=The Recluse
artist=William Wordsworth
album=The Recluse
comment=http://archive.org/details/recluse_1404_librivox
CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000
CHAPTER01NAME=01 - The Recluse (pages 1-18)
CHAPTER02=00:15:32.010
CHAPTER02NAME=02 - The Recluse (pages 19-36)
CHAPTER03=00:30:33.012
CHAPTER03NAME=03 - The Recluse (pages 37-54)
--file ends here--

Save it as ANSI/ASCII text file. You can do this using notepad.
(Don't include -- lines. Comment is optional.)


If you already have audio prepared as opus codec, use it as a source of audio. also, audio codec is "-c:a copy", since we do not need to reencode it again.
fmpeg.exe -i D:\book.opus -i D:\metadata.txt -map_metadata 1 -c:a copy "D:\book_with_chapters.opus"  

(I do not know how to use command line, to add cover image to opus/oga/ogg file.
Mp3tag, from mp3tag.de can add cover image to opus files. 
It can also edit ogg/oga files but only with VORBIS codec inside, not with OPUS codec inside. (Vorbis codec makes bigger files)
To do so, drop file into mp3tag program windows. Right click on file, select extended tags, and edit.)


NOTE:
Say you have m4b file with cover image, and you wish to convert it to ogg format. Now, ogg container can contain video too, unlike oga container.
If you use the command:
fmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b -i D:\metadata.txt -map_metadata 1:s -c:a opus -b:a 16k "D:\book_with_chapters.ogg" 
it will encode cover image as video in the output file, which is not good.
Add "-map 0:a" to the command line, which says: from the first file (0), take audio stream only (a). Example:
fmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b -i D:\metadata.txt -map 0:a -map_metadata 1 -c:a opus -b:a 16k "D:\book_with_chapters.ogg" 
Which will copy audio only from the first file.







Using MMG to create audio books in mka container:
Program mmg.exe from mkvtoolnix package can be used to put already compressed audio to .mka  container file. It is a program with graphical interface.
Image can be added too, as an attachment. https://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/

MMG needs in 'ogg chapter' format. Make a file chapters.txt, and add it in the mmg program (globa/chapters/browse):
--
CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000
CHAPTER01NAME=01 - The Recluse (pages 1-18)
CHAPTER02=00:15:32.010
CHAPTER02NAME=02 - The Recluse (pages 19-36)
CHAPTER03=00:30:33.012
CHAPTER03NAME=03 - The Recluse (pages 37-54)
--


OTHER PROGRAMS:
Mp3tag from mp3tag.de can add cover image to the audio file.
Kid3 from kid3.sf.net can add it using command line, or gui.
There is also vorbiscomment.exe for ogg files.
There is also easytag.

Mp4box can only work with ogg containers with vorbis codec inside.



OTHER FFMPEG COMMANDS

-extract book cover as an image:
ffmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b d:\book-cover.jpg
(You can get this information using ffmpeg -i inputfile )


-display file info
ffmpeg -i D:\book.m4b

-extract metadata to ffmetadata text file. You can open it with wordpad, or notepad+ :

ffmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b -f ffmetadata D:\ffmetadata.txt
(Ffmetadata.txt is in different format than metadata.txt, although first line inside is the same.
Ffmetadata format is used with mka files. Oga/opus files use different format, that is chapters are written differently. And it is ansi/ascii encoding.)


-you can also extract chapter info to a simple csv file
(This is not used directly in the process of adding chaper marks.)

ffprobe.exe -i D:\book.m4b -print_format compact -sexagesimal -show_chapters > D:\metadata-compact.txt
or in slightly different way to separate columns:
ffprobe.exe -i D:\book.m4b -print_format csv -sexagesimal -show_chapters > D:\metadata-csv.txt



The following only works for mka, not oga/opus files. (You can add cover using attach command mentioned above):
-create mka, using ffmpeg, BUT copy information from external M4B file:
(if the audio is not already encoded)
ffmpeg.exe -i d:\book.mp3 -i D:\book-with-info.m4b -map_metadata 1 -c:a opus -b:a 16k "D:\book_with_chapters.mka" 

(if the audio is already encoded)
ffmpeg.exe -i d:\book.opus -i D:\book-with-info.m4b -map_metadata 1 -c:a copy "D:\book_with_chapters.mka" 

-create mka, using ffmpeg, BUT copy information from external FFMETADATA.TXT file
To get ffmetadata: ffmpeg.exe -i D:\book.m4b -f ffmetadata D:\ffmetadata.txt
Note: Here we use unmodified ffmetadata file, which is different from oga/opus/mmg chapters format. 
ffmpeg.exe -i d:\book.mp3 -i d:\ffmetadata.txt -map_metadata 1 -c:a opus -b:a 16k "D:\book_with_chapters.mka"
