How to stream dvb-t channels using vlc:
Note: you can replace vlc with cvlc, if you do not want graphical user interface. Also no memory leak?
This is in linux, started in terminal/command line.

vlc "/home/user/viva.avi"   --sout '#transcode{vcodec=theo,vb=800,scale=0.5,acodec=vorb,ab=48,channels=1}:duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=192.168.1.11:8080}}'
Would stream file viva.avi in local area network, using theora codec, bitrate 800kbit, scale video to half it's size, 
audio codec vorbis, 48kbit, 1 channel. 
Output would be visible on local display, and it would stream from streaming machine with address 192.168.1.11, on port 8080.
(Address of the machine vlc is started)
If you remove "dst=display," it would only stream on the LAN, it would not show on local display


vlc dvb:// :dvb-adapter=0 :dvb-frequency=490000000 :dvb-srate=0 :program=1  --sout '#transcode{vcodec=theo,vb=800,scale=0.5,acodec=vorb,ab=48,channels=1}:duplicate{dst=display,dst=std{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=192.168.1.11:8080}}'
stream dvb-t frequency 490000000 Khz, program 1, same codec as above.


vlc dvb:// :dvb-adapter=0 :dvb-frequency=490000000 :dvb-srate=0 :program=1  --sout '#transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vb=800,scale=0.5,acodec=mpga,ab=48,channels=1}:duplicate{dst=std{access=http,mux=ts,dst=192.168.1.11:8080}}'
stream dvb-t frequency 490000000 Khz, program 1, mpeg codec, ts stream. Lower quality, less processor %.

If you want to stream multiple channels you have to put inside another card and put splitter on the antenna cable.
Change dvb-adapter to 1, program to 2, port to 8081.

Or, you can try program getstream, which I haven't been able to use successfully.


To watch the stream, open VLC, Open network stream, select http:// and add 192.168.1.11:8080.
this will work only in local area network, (192.168.1.xxxx)


You can use wscan to scan for channels.Here is the line for mplayer:
w_scan -ft -c AT -X -R N -O N >> ~/.mplayer/channels.conf
