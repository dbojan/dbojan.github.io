How to remove non printable ascii letters from file names

Explanation:

This program will replace non ascii printable characters, with underscore "_", using powershell script on Windows 7.
Only ASCII printable characters are allowed.
That means letters ranging from space, !, to ~, are allowed
NOTE: Delete command (ascii 127, unicode u007E), is part of printable ascii, but is removed here. To undo, rename 7E to 7F . 
Everything else will be replaced with "_" .

HERE is Howto create the powershell script:
-save this file as 'renamefiles.ps1', without quotes,
 in directory c:\temp, without start and end part.

--start file--
$Files = gci | where {$_.Name -match "[^\u0020-\u007E]"}

$Files | ForEach-Object {
$OldName = $_.Name
$NewName = $OldName -replace "[^\u0020-\u007E]", "_"
ren $_ $NewName
}
--end file--

Howto enable windows 7 power shell:

this requires windows 7 power shell
to be able to run scripts in ps, you have to enable it:
-find powershell in start menu, right click on it, and select 'run as administrator'.
-type in window: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
-type in window: y
-close powershell, and start it again as user
-change to directory where you file is: cd c:\temp
-run progam (you can type re, and then press tab to finish filename automatically): 
-& '.\renamefiles.ps1'
