<pre>
I want page numbers to start from page 4: (office 2007)

INSERT PAGE NUMBERS:
-insert/page number/bottom of page


SHOW HIDDEN CHARS:
-home/show - hide (reverse P)




CREATE NEW SECTION, THAT WILL GO FROM PAGE 4 ONWARDS: 
-click on page 3

-INSERT NEW SECTION BREAK:
-page layout/breaks/section breaks/next page
(you can delete page break on page 3 if you have it)
(now, everything under "section break-next page" mark, will be a new section)





REMOVE "LINK TO PREVIOUS" SETTING:
-Double click on "page number" on page 4 (in footer, at the bottom of the page.)
-uncheck "link to previous" (in the toolbar named "Design")
(also remove "different first page" if selected)

(Double click on middle of the page to exit footer)




REMOVE Page numbers in first section:
-Double click on page number 1, (in footer)
-insert/page number/remove page number



SET numbers to start from 1 (in second section):
-Double click on page number 4 (in footer)
insert/page number/format page number/start at=1
