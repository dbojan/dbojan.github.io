<pre>
rem number will go from 1-63, in steps of 1
rem paste this in command line (you also need wget):
for /L %i in (1,1,63) do wget http://somesite.com/%i.jpg



rem display all files
FOR %i in (*.*)  do echo "%~nxi"



rem output to file
FOR %i in (*.*)  do echo "%~nxi" >> c:\list.txt



rem change to current dir (where bat file is started from)
cd /d "%~dp0"
rem use %%, because it is in a .bat file now, not started from the comamnd line:
FOR %%i in (*.*)  do echo "%%~nxi" >> c:\list.txt
