<body>If your fan control on your 3870 does not work, here is how to flash it:<br><br>Some files: <a href="flashfiles.zip">here</a><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">-DON'T USE ATIWINFLASH.exe</span>.
Your system will hang. Your card will not work, and you will have to do
it with another or integrated video card. Use atiflash.exe<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Backup your bios</span><br>-use gpu-z to backup your video card bios. Click on bios chip icon near bios version in gpu-z. (save to file, ending in .bin)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modify your bios</span><br>-download program RBE_128. (Radeon bios editor.)<br>-load bios. Find your .bin file.<br>-go to fan settings<br>-click on "set all fan setting to recommended values".<br>-file/save bios. Save as file, ending in .rom.<br>-exit program<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flashing your video card</span><br>-find and download atiflash_386.zip. <br>-download boottoolkit from vuks.vdsworld.com. <br><br>-<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Create iso with atiflash.exe and your modified bios file</span>-<br>-unzip atiflash.zip<br>-unzip boottoolkit to d:\temp<br>-copy atiflash.exe to D:\temp\flash\boottoolkit\files (assuming you unzipped boottolkit file to d:\temp)<br>-rename your saved bios from <span style="font-weight: bold;">"2D - 300, 900, 1.134 3D - 825, 900, 1.214.rom</span>" like name to <span style="font-weight: bold;">"myfixed.rom"</span>. Make sure it has the same ending as the original name, which is <span style="font-weight: bold;">.rom</span>.<br>-copy myfixed.rom to D:\temp\flash\boottoolkit\files.<br>-delete bootcd.iso file, if it exists, in D:\temp\flash\boottoolkit\.<br>-Click on make_boot_iso.bat, to create new bootcd.iso.<br>&nbsp;(alternative
method is to use Ultraiso to modify bootcd.iso from boottollkit
package. Atiflash.exe and myfixed.rom should be at the root of the iso
file.)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">-Flash from dos</span>-<br>-Burn iso to the cd, or cdrw.<br>-If you have UPS, connect your PC to it.<br>-Setup PC, in bios, to boot from cd. <br>-Boot pc.<br>-Select "Boot with CD support"<br>-after booting, type C:, or D: to get to atiflash.exe<br>-use "dir" to display direcotry content, "cd newdirectory", to change directory<br>-to flash card type this:<br>&nbsp;"<span style="font-weight: bold;">atiflash -i</span>" will give you info on ati cards present.

I used this after first unsuccessful flash. Second one was successfull. :)<br><br>It
is best if you can make flash from your own card. If not try to find
one from the same version/manufacturer video card, &nbsp;and/or the
one&nbsp;with the same bios size.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Testing</span><br>-You can change video card fan speed and memory speed with Riva tuner. Ati tray tools did not work for me.<br>-In Riva tuner go to&nbsp;the main tab. Click on the triangle near Customize. Select first icon.<br>-Go to fan tab.<br>-Enable low level fan control. set speed to auto and enable "Apply fan settings at Windows startup."<br>-You can watch fan speed temp with gpu-z.<br>-You can monitor/test your gpu with with Furmark. Also Gpu-z comes with the same package.<br><br><br>Instal monitor drivers if you get out of sync problem (unrelated to bios flashing.)<br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Doing it with another video card</span><br>Here is how:<br><br>I used pci card (really old S3 graphic card. It goes in the same pci slot that separate lan card, modem, or sound card goes, <br>PCI)<br><br>Go
to bios of your pc. I used Asus motherboard. In the pci? settings there
is an option of which video card you want to initalize first, which
pair to use.<br>I used pci card, and my Ati card was PCIEx So my bios
was set PCI/PCiex. PCI is old S3 card, PCiex is new 3870. I could not
get video when it was set to integrated/PCIEX. I could see things on
monitor, but,&nbsp;atiflash could not find ati adapter.<br><br>If you have motherboard with Integrad video card, then you shoud use Integrated/PCIEx order, I suppose.<br><br><br></body></html>
