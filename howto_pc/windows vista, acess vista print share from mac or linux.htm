1. Open the Run command and type "secpol.msc".
2. Press "continue" when prompted by Vista.
3. Click on "Local Policies" --> "Security Options"
4. Navigate to the policy "Network Security: LAN Manager authentication level" and open it. 
5. By default Windows Vista sets the policy to "NTVLM2 responses only". 
Change this to "LM and NTLM – use NTLMV2 session security if negotiated".
