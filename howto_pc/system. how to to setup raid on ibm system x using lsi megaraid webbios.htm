how to to setup raid on ibm system x using megaraid webbios

I would like to say that lsi webbios megaraid setup is total crap. 
It is slow and unintuitive. Look on asus or gigabyte mb, how to create
fast, usable raid setup bios.


ibm system x raid setup

f1
system settings
addapters
pci / card lsi


drives
click on drive underlined on the right
make unconf good


You can try using wizard to clear configuration.
Or using reset option on drives.

As a result drive status should be unconf good. :), which means they are ready to be configured.

After they are unconf good, you can set drive(s) with lsi webbios, or leave them be, and use 
ibm server guide to setup raid, install drivers, etc. 
If you do use ibm server guide, and have one hdd, use option "controler default" in ibm server guide. In the part of setting
raid.


Or if you use lsi webbios for setup:
conf. wizard.
manual

 auto config)
