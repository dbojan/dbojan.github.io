<pre>
windows xp, create html index of files in current directory

Here: <a href="create html list of files.zip">create html list of files.zip</a>.
Download it, and put "1create html list of files.bat" file in folder with html or htm files. It will create/overwrite index.html

Files might be sorted according to extension, so make sure they all end in .htm or .htmL

If you start it from usb memory stick, files will be sorted according to the time of writing.
To fix it, copy dir with files and bat file to hard disk, and start bat file from there.
