e-mail, create new e-mail alert when you receive e-mail in outlook

Note: This only works while outlook is running. You can lock your workstation with WIN + L keys.
You can test this by sending you e-mail from yourself.

This is useful if you can get sms notification when you receive mail on yournumber@YourMobileProvider.com.
So you can set up outlook to send you e-mail, when you receive e-mail in outlook.
Use this setup if you DO NOT WANT TO FORWARD THE WHOLE MESSAGE, for which are options already exist in outlook rules. (without the use of vbscript)

Also you cannot use, 'reply using template', or 'have server reply' since it will send reply
to the original sender. This is not what we want. 


<b>1. Create self certificate</b> 
using selfcert.exe, which is part of microsoft office.
Without this, after you restart outlook, vb scripts wont run, due to security settings.

-run 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\selfcert.exe'
Enter 'Your Name - Outlook'


<b>2. Create VB script in outlook that does all the job</b>

-open outlook 2016
-press alt + F11 to get into vb script editor
-right click on project1 and select 'insert module'
-enter the following text in the editor screen, without --start--, and --end--:

--start--
Sub SendNew(Item As Outlook.MailItem)
MsgBox "Mail message arrived"
Dim objMsg As MailItem
Set objMsg = Application.CreateItem(olMailItem)
objMsg.To = "yournumber@YourMobileProvider.com, or whatever e-mail address you want notifications to arrive at"
objMsg.CC = "you can enter yet another e-mail address to send notification to"
objMsg.BCC = ""
objMsg.Subject = Item.Subject & ", from: " & Item.SenderName
objMsg.Send
End Sub
--end--

notes:
After everything is working, add ' in front MsgBox "Mail message arrived" so msgbox is not displayed anyomore. It will look like this:
'MsgBox "Mail message arrived"
or just delete that line.
This will display message box info window, so you know your script is running.

You can use Item.SenderEmailAddress instead of Item.SenderName if you want.
CC, and BCC will be cleared. (On the e-mail you send).

If you wish to add first 75 chars of the messsage body, to the new message subject line, use this:
objMsg.Subject = Mid(Item.SenderName, 1, 10) & ", " & Item.Subject & ", " & Mid(Item.Body, 1, 75)
It creates new subject with 10 chars of the sender name + item subject + 75 chars of the messsage body.

<b>3. Sign your project in vb script editor</b>

-start outlook, press alt + F11, 
-make sure project is selected in the left screen. if there is only one project then it is selected by default.
-select from the menu 'tools'/'digital signature'
-click on 'choose' to choose your newly created certificate.
-select certificate, click on ok. 
-in the small Digital signature window, it should say something like 'This vba project is currentlu signed as', your name here...
-click on 'tools'/'digital signature' to check if it is signed.
-your whole PROJECT will be signed, not just one module
-close vb editor window.



<b>4. Create new rule in outlook</b>

-click on file, and select 'manage rules and alerts' on the right pane.
-click on 'new rule'
-click on the 'apply rules on messages I receive' at the mid-bottom part, next
-next, outlook will inform you this rule will be applied to all the messages you recieve
 (otherwise, you can enter here a mail sender by choosing 'from people or public group')
-select 'run a script', click on 'a script' at the botom
-select your script, 'Project.SendNew'
-next, next, finish.



<b>5. Allow your signed macro to r</b>un.

-send yourself a message, and restart outlook.

-note: make sure your macro security in 'the trust center' is set to:
 'warnings for signed macros, all unsigned macros are disabled'
 
-when new message arrives, you should see window: 'microsoft office outlook security notice'

-click on 'show signature details'
if it is your signature, click on 'trust all documents from this publisher'

-if you get error 'all macros are disabled', delete your rule and try again.
or delete script and recrate it again. make sure script is signed, by going to
'tools'/'digital signature' in vb editor.

-if all goes well, add ' in front of MsgBox "Mail message arrived", in vb script editor, or delete that line.
-save your project by clicking on blue floppy disk icon.

-it is generally bad idea to disable security for all macros, in case you are thinking about that.






<b>6. bonus/alternative ANOTHER option is to 'start an application' instead, using the rules</b> 
(create bat file that uses sendmail.exe and gmail account to send you email.)
no subject and sender information, though.

something like this:
save 'sendnewmail.bat' file in mailsend dir.
change first 3 lines that start with 'set'

--start--
@echo off
cd /d %~dp0

set user="your newly created gmail account@gmail.com"
set password="gmail pass"
set to="enter destination mail"
set from=%user%
set subject="You've got mail"
mailsend.exe -t %to% -f %from% -ssl -port 465 -auth -smtp smtp.gmail.com -sub %subject% -user %user% -pass %password% -M " "

pause

rem -M is for message, won't work without it, asks for message to type in.
--end--


You can create shortcut to bat file, and set it to run minimized. After that select shortcut to run from outlook rules screen.
Make sure you select to display all files, not just .exe in the 'select an application to execute' window.

if you wish to send attachment, you can use sendmail for that too: 
mailsend -t %to% -f %from% -ssl -port 465 -auth -smtp smtp.gmail.com -sub %subject% -user %user% -pass %password% -attach "path to file","application/octet-stream",a
to use multiple address separate 'to' field addresses with commas, but don't spam people!

(vba project is saved in C:\Users\bojan\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Outlook\VbaProject.OTM
if you delete it, you will delete your vb scripts in outlook.)

-Also, remember to login to your mobile provider mail account and delete excess mail, so your inbox does not
overflow.
