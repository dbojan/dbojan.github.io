DOWNLOAD:

from <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/">http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/</a>
download:
-click on "Qt libraries 4.8.0 for Windows (minGW 4.4, 354 MB)", and download BOTH files:
"qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.0.zip" (350 MB)  and "MinGW-gcc440_1.zip" (30 MB)

-click on "Qt Creator 2.4.0 for Windows (53 MB)" and download
"qt-creator-win-opensource-2.4.0.exe"



INSTALL MINGW, QT, QT CREATOR:

-install minigw (MinGW-gcc440_1.zip):
 	-unzip to c:\minigw
-add path c:\mingiw\bin to path:
	-start/my computer/propeties/advanced/environment variables/SYSTEM variables
	-scroll to PATH.
	-double click on Path, at the end add ";c:\minigw\bin", without quotes. OK, OK.
-restart PC. 
 (Or just use task manager to restart explorer. Then: "File/ new task run/explorer". "Start/run/ cmd", type "set",
 check if at the end of path line there is ";c:\minigw\bin")



-install qt-win-opensource-4.8.0-mingw.exe


-install qt-creator-win-opensource-2.4.0.exe (without minigw, uncheck it during setup.)



POST INSTALLATION SETUP:

-Open "qt creator", go to menu: "tools/options/build & run/qt version/manual/add" "c:\qt\4.8.0\bin\qmake.exe", 
 or correct path for your installation
(as an alternative you run configure.exe from qt dir. takes long time, not sure if it is recommended.)



You can add c:\qt\4.8.0\bin to "path" if you wish to run compiled programs from explorer too.




ADDITIONAL NOTES:

note 1:
no tooclhain error: add c:\mingiw\bin to path

note 2:
(do make your program work with smaller qt.dll files, select release build in main qt win.
 This is not done during creating project)
