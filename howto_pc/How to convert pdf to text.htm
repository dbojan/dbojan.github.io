How to convert pdf to text

NON OCR (Optical character recognition)
Free solutions

We assume the text can be selected in PDF Reader. (Use the select tool, right click in Adobe Reader, select thing that looks like T, 
and try selecting text)

In this case, text is saved as letters, not images inside pdf.
Here are the possible ways to convert PDF to text. These are free, non paying solutions:

-use smallpdf.com/pdf-to-word free service. convert up to 2 files per hour. Rating 5
-use microsoft word online. Login to onedrive.live.com, upload pdf file, and then select Open in word online. 
 Then select edit in word online again. Rating 4.5
-use pdf2docx.com. Up to 20 files at once. Rating 4

-If you don't care about text flow, and don't care about images, select text, and copy it to Text editor/Word.
 In Adobe Reader you can click on 'file' in the menu, 'save as other...', 'text', or 'edit', 'copy file to clipboard',
 and paste it to word (edit/paste)
 

others:
-bluefox pdf converter. possibly tries to install malware. say no. converts to big doc files.
-unipdf-some errors.


paying:
-ABBYY FineReader 12 Professional - 129Euro. Best, very expensive. Can do Optical character recognition too. 
 trial version can has limitations (100 pages total, only saves first 3 pages from pdf?).
 
-ABBYY PDF Transformer+ - 69Euro. Cheaper version, still expensive. I think it supports OCR too.

How to use Tesseract to convert pdf to text (Advanced):
(We assume text in pdf cannot be selected, and it needs to be OCR-ed first.)

Install Ghostscript to d:\apps\ocr\gs, and Tesseract-ocr to d:\apps\ocr\Tesseract-ocr.

You can use this script to convert pdf to txt:

Create text file in notepad. Rename it ocr-pdf.bat.
Put it in d:\apps\ocr directory.
(Don't add ---file... part in it), 

---file start:---
cd /d %~dp0
gs\bin\gswin32c.exe -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 -sDEVICE=tiffgray -sCompression=pack -r300  -o  %1.tif  %1 
Tesseract-ocr\tesseract.exe  %1.tif -l eng %1-ocr 
del %1.tif
pause

---file end---

Drag and drop pdf file on ocr-pdf.bat.



More info:
If you wish to select different pages from PDF to process, use "-dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1" after -r2400, as such:

gs\bin\gswin32c.exe -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=5 -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 -sDEVICE=tiffgray -sCompression=pack -r300  -o  %1.tif  %1 

Which would convert first 5 pages to tif, and then tesseractOCR would convert them to txt, instead of working on all pages in PDF.
