If you want to learn a new language, I suggest Python v3, instead. Use PythonPortable with PyScripter.
You can learn from "Byte of Python" book. More info <a href="http://dbojan.50webs.com/freeware/">here, bottom of the page.</a>


Java:
You can use lightweight <a href="http://www.jcreator.com/">JCreator LE</a> which is free.
Install it on your machine. After that you can copy it to usb stick. It will ask for java install,
if it can't find it.


Portable eclipse:
-download from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>, "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" Windows 32 Bit
-install to "D:\java\eclipse_portable"

-download jdk 7u2 from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u2-download-1377129.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u2-download-1377129.html</a>, 
"jdk-7u2-windows-i586.exe" for Windows x86
-install to "D:\java\jdk1.7.0_01"

-create dir "workspace" in "D:\java\eclipse_portable"
-Start Eclipse. When prompted enter ".\workspace" for the workspace dir, or ".\somethingelse" . ".\" means in current directory.
-you can see workspace path, by going to menu  "windows/preferences" in eclipse. Type "workspace" in search box.

-copy "jre" dir from "D:\java\jdk1.7.0_01" to "D:\java\eclipse_portable"
-open "D:\java\eclipse_portable\eclipse.ini" with WORDPAD or NOTEPAD2
-add "-vm .\jre\bin\javaw" to the end of the eclipse.ini file.

-(explanation: 
let's say your thumb drive is named f:\
if you want to keep whole jdk on f:\java\jdk1.7.0_01, and your eclipse on "f:\java\eclipse_portable"
then use line "-vm ..\jdk1.7.0_01\jre\bin\javaw" in eclipse.ini instead.
It will look in f:\java\jdk1.7.0_01, instead of f:\java\eclipse_portable\jre\bin\javaw
This is optional.)


Copy eclipse_portable dir to your usb flash memory. 
(Optional: If you want to carry portable app ready to install, zip dir first, and then copy it to usb flash memory. 
You will have to copy it to target PC, and unzip before use.)


NOTE:
-click on help/welcome to start tutorial. 
-Click on "Window/open perspective/Java" or, "Window/reset perspective" if you don't see package manager.
-Eclipse does not add ";" to the end line, unlike netbeans
-sometimes you have to close eclipse.exe manually after exit from eclipse windows.)
-First run/project will be slower.
-You will get better performance if you copy files to hard disk, and run it from there.

Portable netbeans:
-download from <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/">http://netbeans.org/downloads/</a> "NetBeans IDE 7.0.1", type JAVA SE
-install to "D:\java\NetBeans7.0.1_portable"
-don't change jdk path

You don't have to install junit

copy jdk1.7.0_01 dir to "D:\java\NetBeans7.0.1_portable"

create "startnetbeans.bat" in "D:\java\NetBeans7.0.1_portable" dir. 
--
cd /d "%~dp0"
bin\netbeans.exe --userdir "..\netbeanswp" --jdkhome ".\jdk1.7.0_01"
--

Use it to start netbeans.

NOTE:
-you can delete DIRECTORIES "locale", but not files named locale.something.
-You will have to select project save dir manually. Enter something like f:\project, if your usb is f:
-First run/project will be slower.
-You will get better performance if you copy files to hard disk, and run it from there.
