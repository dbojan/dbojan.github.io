media, comics, crop a4 to two a5 images, and rename properly, resize, irfan view, iview

useful for comics.

<a href="crop_images.zip">Here</a> is the bat file.
Edit as needed.

It uses <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">http://www.irfanview.com/</a>.
Edit bat file to set path to IrfanView.

Half is a half of a horizontal size of scanned image.
So if page is 2000 x 768, enter half as 1000.
You can find image dimensions, when you open image in the IrfanView. 
It is at the bottom of the window.
Or press i.
Images are also rotated left. delete /rotate_l option if you do not need rotation.

Left images have a appended, right b. :)

To crop images put bat file in directory with jpg files and start it.
It will create test dir with cropped images.


Note:
If you want to resize image <b>before</b> rotation use: /resample=(500,0) /aspectratio   /rotate_l.
If you want to resize image <b>after</b> rotation use:  /rotate_l  /resample=(500,0) /aspectratio.
This will resize image to 500 x proportional.

Delete /rotate_l option if you do not need rotation.


Explanation of settings:
set half=1000 : half of the horizontal size
set outdir=test : name of the output dir in current dir
set iview=D:\apps\iview397\i_view32.exe : path to IrfanView
set extin=jpg : extension of input images
set extout=jpg : extension of output images


--start bat here:

cd /d %~dp0
