How to use mobile gprs-edge modem on pc, and share internet connection

<b>Install usb modem</b>

Plug in huawei e170 usbmodem card to your pc.
It should be added as a new modem, and optical storage drive.

Install drivers from newfound cd drive.

To check if it installed correctly: 
right click on "my computer", manage/device manager.
Click on + in front of modems.


<b>Create profile</b>

Link to mobile partner program should appear on desktop.
Click on it.
when you click on tools/device, you should be able to select your modem device.

To create new profile go to:
tools/options/profile/new.
profile name: mtel (or whatever you want)
apn/static=mtelfun (mtelfun is for my provider, check with yours.)
access number=*99#
Save.

Click connect on main window to test your connection.
(make sure you disable your "local area network" network connection, if you have
broadband Internet connection)
Disconnect mobile connection.

<b>Set up "Internet connection sharing"</b>.

Right click on "my network places"on the desktop, then click on "properties" .

Right click on mtel, then click on "properties" .

In "general"/"connect using" select: "huawei modem"
Go to "advanced"/"internet connection sharing"/"allow other network users"=yes.
Select  name of local area connection. usually: "Local area connection".

Connect "Internet pc"<->switch<->"other pc" using regular net cable (aka "patch")

Or "Internet pc"<->other pc, using crossover lan cable.
It is a sort of shortcut type of cable, for connecting 2 PC directly together. 
Most cables are "patch" type, though.
