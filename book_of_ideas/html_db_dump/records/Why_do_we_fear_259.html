Or our body being hurt.<BR>
We will have to shed this body at some time.<BR>
We don't actually own anything. After we leave this planet, things will not be along with us. Things will not belong to us, just like they never did.<BR>
<BR>
Our life is not ours. It is a gift from God?<BR>
<BR>
Our soul lives forever.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
