In a way this is a test. You may be aware that a long time ago a similar <b>group asked for sanctuary</b> on your planet. At that time you lived in what we might call a <b>garden of Eden</b>, a delicate and beautiful world and you decided to give these beings sanctuary. The thought was that they could heal their spiritual wounds here, well instead they infected the rest of you. You've <b>learned</b> a great deal though and the result has been an acceleration of your evolution, but now when you consider such requests you have more wisdom<BR>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism<BR>
<BR>
<b>dualism</b> can mean the tendency of humans to perceive and understand the world as being <b>divided into two overarching categories</b>. In this sense, it is dualistic when one perceives a tree as a thing separate from everything surrounding it, or when one perceives <b>a"self" that is distinct from the rest of the world</b>. In traditions such as classical Hinduism, Zen Buddhism or Islamic Sufism, a key to enlightenment is "transcending" this sort of dualistic thinking, without merely substituting dualism with monism or pluralism.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
