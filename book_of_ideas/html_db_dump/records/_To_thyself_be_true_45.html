<BR>
<BR>
Yet here, Laertes! Aboard, aboard for shame!<BR>
 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<BR>
 And you are stay'd for.<BR>
 There ... my blessing with thee!<BR>
 And these few precepts in thy memory<BR>
 Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<BR>
 Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.<BR>
 Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<BR>
 Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<BR>
 Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<BR>
 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<BR>
 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade.  Beware<BR>
 Of entrance to a quarrel but, being in,<BR>
 Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.<BR>
 Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<BR>
 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement.<BR>
 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<BR>
 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<BR>
 For the apparel oft proclaims the man;<BR>
 And they in France of the best rank and station<BR>
 Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<BR>
 Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;<BR>
 For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<BR>
 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<BR>
<BR>
 This above all: to thine own self be true,<BR>
 And it must follow, as the night the day,<BR>
 Thou canst not then be false to any man.<BR>
<BR>
 Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!<BR>
<BR>
