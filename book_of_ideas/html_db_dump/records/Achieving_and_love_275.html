Women are happiest when they are loved. And when they love. <BR>
You can see them shining (women) when in love.<BR>
<BR>
Men achieve, women love. Then they thrive.<BR>
from the "Shack"<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Men, women need your love more then they need you achieving.<BR>
So instead of staying late at work, go to your home.<BR>
They need you. Not your achievements. (Although they will be proud of you, they would rather be WITH you.)<BR>
