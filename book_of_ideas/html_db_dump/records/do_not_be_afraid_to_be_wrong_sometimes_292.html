It is the part of growing, expanding ideas.<BR>
See how an idea "feels". Follow your feelings/emotions.<BR>
<BR>
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.<BR>
You will grow (up) through your mistakes.<BR>
You will learn much more from mistakes than from successess.<BR>
People beliefs change.<BR>
<BR>
Don't discard gut feeling.<BR>
Or that fire in your stomach, when you feel something is wrong.<BR>
But don't let anyone tell you right from wrong. Use your own head. Use your stomach.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
