If you don't want to live your life, here is a little experiment. Give me your life to do with it what I want for the next 24 hours. No? How about 2 hours? No? Well, then, it must mean something to you. :) No problem is to great to be solved. God would not give you a problem you are not capable of solving. And, you can always ask friends for help. Or even strangers on the street. What have you got to lose?<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
