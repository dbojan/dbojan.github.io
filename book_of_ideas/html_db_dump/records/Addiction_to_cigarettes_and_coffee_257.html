Because they are an addiction. No one told you that when you started consuming it.<BR>
Even with the message printed on the box of cigarettes : "Smoking is bad for your health", some people don't quit smoking. Or can't.<BR>
<BR>
The only way is to use something producing the opposite of these things:<BR>
unpleasure. So every time you drink, coffee, coke or smoke a cigar, you'll feel sick.<BR>
Otherwise your body will remain a prisoner to these addictions.<BR>
<BR>
Use fruit or water instead. Or vegetables, like carrots. :)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
