Not some almighty deity.<BR>
<BR>
You.<BR>
<BR>
You are responsible for your own actions.<BR>
<BR>
You create your future, just like you create playlist on your mp3 player.<BR>
You are in control.<BR>
<BR>
This is your reality. Your universe.<BR>
You create it. This universe is physical manifestation of your thoughts.<BR>
You are in charge here. <BR>
<BR>
Whether you will be benevolent or malevolent is up to you.<BR>
And literary up to you. What you create will reflect, and apply to you.<BR>
<BR>
You are connected to everything. Everything is connected to you.<BR>
Everything relates to you, is teaching YOU something, showing you something.<BR>
You are the center of your Universe. In fact, you are your universe. You create it.<BR>
Your universe in manifestation of you. Your instance.<BR>
<BR>
Anything is possible :) Nothing is impossible.<BR>
Have an open heart. Let love guide you. Compassion, but not pitty.<BR>
<BR>
Learn. Let love and light in. "Let the sunshine in"<BR>
<BR>
Do not be afraid. Do not be sad.<BR>
You have friends. Choose them wisely.<BR>
Choose your future.<BR>
Use your own head.<BR>
And remember to smile :)<BR>
