<BR>
Hate can consume you like a cancer. Leaving no place for good things.<BR>
The world we see/live is the mirror of us. The way we want to see it, the way we want to have it.<BR>
To change the world we have to change ourselves first.<BR>
Start with a smile :) . And go easy on you. You are not that bad.<BR>
<BR>
To love others you have to start with yourself.<BR>
To love others you have to love yourself first.<BR>
Let the sunshine in :)<BR>
<BR>
Listen to your soul/self.<BR>
That little voice inside of you. Celebrating you. Celebrating the world. They are the same.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
