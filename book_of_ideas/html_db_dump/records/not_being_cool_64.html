Why are you so afraid of not being cool?<BR>
So what? Follow your path/story. Listen to the voice inside of you. Your voice. Not voice of the others.<BR>
You will make some mistakes. It is part of growing up.<BR>
You will look ridiculous sometimes. :) That is ok too. :) It happens to all of us from time to time. :)<BR>
