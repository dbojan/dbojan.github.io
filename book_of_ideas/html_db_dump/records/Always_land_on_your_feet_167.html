There will be times when you are knocked down. It's okay, as long as you get up again.<BR>
GET UP.<BR>
Prepare yourself to be knocked down sometimes. Program yourself not to be down with the spirit, to get up automatically, when knocked down.<BR>
<BR>
Find a solution to the problem. Eliminate the source, not just the consequence.<BR>
Have no fear/ Do not let fear misguide you.<BR>
Positive leap forward.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
