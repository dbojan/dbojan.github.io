Maybe she wants something else. Vanilla and chocolate are both good, though different.<BR>
Maybe she is in point in life, when she cannot be with someone. Or she needs someone, or something else.<BR>
<BR>
Don't judge a man till you have walked a mile in his shoes.<BR>
<BR>
"Breaking up is never easy"<BR>
Maybe it was difficult for her to break up with you, too...<BR>
<BR>
So be kind to her. Though you are parting ways, it does not mean you have to stop being friends, and see eachother when walking by, or talking from time to time.<BR>
It does not mean you should stop being friends.<BR>
It does not mean you should stop being friend to her.<BR>
It does not mean you should stop talking to her, or be embarrassed to/when you see her.<BR>
She is still the girl she has always been :).  Remember that.<BR>
If she does not want you as a love, if she does not see you as lover, perhaps you can still be friend to her.<BR>
(Unless she says I don't (ever) want to see you again. In that case, apologize, and walk away.)<BR>
<BR>
Maybe she needs a friend now.<BR>
<BR>
Girl will miss you, if you have been good friend to her.<BR>
So when she says: "I hope we can still be friends", she probably means it.<BR>
It does not mean: I want to hurt you even more with these words, (as some men hear it :)<BR>
<BR>
Maybe she wants you to go on with your life.<BR>
