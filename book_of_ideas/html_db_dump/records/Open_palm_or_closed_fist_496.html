When someone "attacks you" with word, you choose either to respond with attack, or to go calmly at him/her.<BR>
Lower the tension, and try to understand why he or she is attacking you.<BR>
Maybe someone else made one angry or annoyed.<BR>
Maybe one is scared, or annoyed, or just having a bad day.<BR>
<BR>
Go easy on him/her. :)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Choose open palm or closed fist when communicating with others.<BR>
How do you know which is which?<BR>
Just ask your heart.<BR>
Just follow your heart.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
