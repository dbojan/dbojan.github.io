<BR>
Plan ahead, if you do not want to be late.<BR>
<BR>
Make a plan with a timetable. Visualize it in your head. Your leaving at exact time.<BR>
THAT (whatever you are doing now, instead of what you should be doing) can wait. Now, move!<BR>
You have made a plan. And a promise. Intention.<BR>
Intend to be on time.<BR>
<BR>
It is that simple. Millions people arrive on time every day :)<BR>
From now on, you will be/are one of them. Say it:<BR>
I will not be late. I intend to arrive on my destination on time.<BR>
<BR>
Or just use an alarm clock, and have it ring continuously.<BR>
But seriously. You can make it/be on time.<BR>
