good: teaches/encourages you to think, analyze, come to conclusions, do things yourself, experiment, with teachers as advisers and guides.<BR>
<BR>
bad: makes you repeat things from books and what teachers say. does not allow questioning authority and status quo.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bad: teaches you about the small things. can't see the wood for the trees.<BR>
good: teaches you (governing) principles, a view from the top.<BR>
