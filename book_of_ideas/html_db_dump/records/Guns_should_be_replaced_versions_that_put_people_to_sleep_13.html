<BR>
People should stop killing each others.<BR>
Many people are wounded, or killed, by accidents.<BR>
Real guns should be banned. It is uncivilized.<BR>
<BR>
It would be best if any weapon should be banned, except for the military personnel.<BR>
That would go psychiatric examination first.<BR>
<BR>
That would definitely stop selling guns at hypermarkets.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
