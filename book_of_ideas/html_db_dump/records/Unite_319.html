People always divide and fight. That has to stop.<BR>
We are all humans. <BR>
Skin, race, eye color, hair color, nationality, different language, religion, sex, age, they should not divide us.<BR>
In the bigger picture they do not matter. <BR>
We have more in common then we have differences.<BR>
We all have the same soul.<BR>
We are all humans.<BR>
Our "differences" should make us more versatile.<BR>
<BR>
Why are people divided?<BR>
Because of the greed, coming from the fear.<BR>
Politics and religion divide us.<BR>
They point to our differences, instead to point what we have in common.<BR>
<BR>
No competitive sport. No competing in sports. Work together. Do not let sports competitiveness divide us.<BR>
Or anything else, like politics and religion.<BR>
<BR>
There is enough for everybody (from "Conversations with God")<BR>
There is no need for fear or greed.<BR>
The consciousness of the people on the planet is changing.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of everyone pulling in their own direction, we will all work together.<BR>
Pick a course and pull together.<BR>
Look what ants can do. And ants are small. <BR>
Imagine what humans could do if all of them work together. <BR>
There would be no limit, to what we can do.<BR>
<BR>
The <b>whole</b> planet working together.<BR>
<BR>
We will look back and think, how foolish we were to be separated from each other.<BR>
How foolish it was to each pull in their own direction...<BR>
<BR>
There will not be change, until we all change the way we think. Until we change what is in our conscience.<BR>
Till we all, or at least majority of us, evolve.<BR>
<BR>
Society advancement is measured not by its technological advancement, but buy the presence of love, light, and spirit in it.<BR>
The advancement of the spirit is what is important. There is no advancement of spirit without love.<BR>
<BR>
A rocket in the Space means nothing, if people are dying of starvation on the streets.<BR>
When people don't have medical help, medical breakthroughs are useless.<BR>
Advancement of the society<BR>
Until we start being nicer to each other, and start treating each others like brothers and sisters,<BR>
nothing is going to change.<BR>
Consciousness of the people on this planet has to increase.<BR>
Currently, greed and fear try to rule the world.<BR>
There are still people dying of starvation, treatable diseases. <BR>
There is enough for everybody. <BR>
There is no need for fear, or greed coming from fear. (from "Conversations with God")<BR>

What ever you do, do it with an open heart. Let love be your guide.<BR>
"Ask yourself, am I doing this out of love? Am I guided by love"<BR>
From Bringers of the Dawn<BR>
<BR>
Add a little love to everything you do. Let it be your secret ingredient.<BR>
<BR>
Only love can save the world.<BR>
Love is the answer, <BR>
Love is the key.<BR>
<BR>
"Maybe one day we'll be united<BR>
And our love won't be divided." from a song...<BR>
<BR>
"Heaven is a place on Earth"<BR>
<BR>
"Love is the answer" :)<BR>
