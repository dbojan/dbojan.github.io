The more fear you clear the safer you and your future will be. You see, safety is not something created outside of you, but inside. As you have learned through quantum science, your thoughts and feelings are what create your reality. If you are projecting fear, you will draw more reasons to feel fear. If, on the other hand, you are projecting calm, relaxed energy, you will draw more reasons to feel calm and relaxed. It is completely up to you. That is why we and many others encourage you to look at your “inner worlds” and “clean house” as you say. We encourage you to take responsibility for all that is in your reality regardless of whether you understand how you created it. Taking responsibility means taking back and owning the power that was used to create the event.<BR>
