</center><P><P>tags: <a href='../tags/gods.html'>gods</a>  <p>Those who want you to call them gods, and pray to them, they are simply powerfull beings. They are not the Creation, or the Source.<BR>
They do not own you. They are not your lords, or masters, or anything.<BR>
They want you to blindly believe in their truth.<BR>
Use your own head. What does it feel like?<BR>
What do your feelings tell you?<BR>
<BR>
They may have the technological knowledge.<BR>
But some, it seems,  do not know much about love. They know more about fear.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
