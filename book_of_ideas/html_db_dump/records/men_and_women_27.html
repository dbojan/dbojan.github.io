They are lead by feelings, men by reason and logic. Reason can be faulty.<BR>
<BR>
if men are sun, women are moon<BR>
if men are day, women are night<BR>
if men are clear, women are mysterious<BR>
if men are logic, women are feelings.<BR>
one cannot live without another<BR>
<BR>
They are opposite of each other<BR>
That is why they need each other so much<BR>
Together they make a whole.<BR>
They complement each other.<BR>
<BR>
She is strong, but she is weak,<BR>
She needs you,<BR>
Just like you need her.<BR>
<BR>
Women can dance better, they follow intuition, feelings, while men try to reason.<BR>
And think how stupid they look. Unlike women, who are enjoying themselves, feeling the energy, vibrations flowing through them :)<BR>
