Money is bad invention. It makes people do things they wouldn't ordinary do. It's like a switch. And people are greedy.<BR>
<BR>
It is hard to sleep peacefully, when you have a lot of money.<BR>
<BR>
Man can not have two lords, especially if one is money/greed.<BR>
<BR>
"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money"<BR>
The Bible<BR>

<BR>
Money and power are highly addictable and corruptible.<BR>
They are like the illness itself, in their own way they could weaken people, make them ill.<BR>
It is hard to let go of material things and feeling of power.<BR>
Not impossible, though :)<BR>
The cure is inside of us. It is called free will. Will to be free. Will to decide by ourselves. <BR>
<BR>
Sing, and dance :)<BR>
