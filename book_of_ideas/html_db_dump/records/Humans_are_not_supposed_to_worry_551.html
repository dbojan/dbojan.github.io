<BR>
What do you need to survive?<BR>
food<BR>
clothes<BR>
place to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Everything else is a bonus.<BR>
Desirable, but not a necessity.<BR>
<BR>
Clothes we wear, cars we drive, they will all disintegrate, in time. Money too.<BR>
Just like material things do.<BR>
You can't take it with you anyway :)<BR>
<BR>
So why worry? :)<BR>
<BR>
It is better to have some fun while we are here. Live a little, love a little.<BR>
All we need is love..<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
