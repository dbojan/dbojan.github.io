<BR>
Just like any other creature.<BR>
It is just that man are sometimes more occupied with "achieving" and "success" than love. But what success can it be without love?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Everybody is looking for affection.<BR>
Like a class full of children, hoping teacher will commend them.<BR>

Like the way children expect affection from their parent. Or animals from their human.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
