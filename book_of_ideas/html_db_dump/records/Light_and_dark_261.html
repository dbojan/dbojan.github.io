There is always light in darkness<BR>
<BR>
When there is light there is no darkness<BR>
when there is darkness, light still persists/exists<BR>
<BR>
We are here to create light cracks in darkness. :) Bit by bit, till light is everywhere, and dark is gone.<BR>
<BR>
Even in the darkness there is a light. You are that light.<BR>
<BR>
In the dark you can't see true colors. Why not step into the light?<BR>
Light is information/knowledge. Darkness is the absence of information/knowledge.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
