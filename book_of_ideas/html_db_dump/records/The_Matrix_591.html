No emotions.<BR>
<BR>
They do not feed on electricity. They feed on fear. On human emotions, and fear.<BR>
<BR>
... And also fear keeps us down.<BR>
<BR>
They have the ability to shape as humans.<BR>
<BR>
Humans, they do not see what is around them. Walking in a dream. (That is what is called a matrix. Data organized so we don't explode from watching 10 channels at once. We could once, but we were changed. Downgraded. But this will change soon. Wake up!)<BR>
<BR>
But they can be beat.<BR>

Neo: I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.<BR>
