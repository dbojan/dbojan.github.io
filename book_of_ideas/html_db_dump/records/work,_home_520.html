prepare meals (breakfast, lunch and supper), wash the dishes afterwards, keep the house clean, dust of the house, vacuum the carpets,  take care of the kids,<BR>
get supplies from the store, occasionally make cookies, organize children's activities (dance, ballet, football).<BR>
Seems like never ending stream of duties. How do woman do this? Maybe because of love? Maybe because it has to be done?<BR>

When man comes home from nothing is expected of him. Maybe paycheck. He expects to have some peace and quiet, so he can to rest.<BR>
And dinner on the table.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps man should ask a woman "What can I do to help you? To make it easier on you"<BR>
<BR>
Now, in perfect world, man would not ask. He would simply start working. But men don't really know what to do, so they ask.<BR>
Ladies, please don't think: "If he has to ask, it means he does not WANT to help, but is asking because he thinks he has to, and does not really want to help.".<BR>
<BR>
Men are much more simple than that.<BR>
Men are simple beast<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
