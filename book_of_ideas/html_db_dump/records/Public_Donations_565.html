How do you make money obsolete? By believing it is obsolete. By giving it away, freely.<BR>
<BR>
1. Open a Public Donations paypal account.<BR>
2. Each month you pay 1$, 2$, 10$, or nothing to this account. Others do the same.<BR>
3. Everyone's transaction is public<BR>
<BR>
4. every 60 days, or when money = 100$, decision is made by consensus of the donors of the group, to give money to someone.<BR>
 examples: kids who need to pay medical bills, people who have no place to sleep, people who have no clothes to wear, or something else<BR>
 (There can be some other timing, not 100$ or 60 days.)<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
5. All donors vote. Voting is public, and transparent. Everyone can check the results.<BR>
<BR>
People vote whom to give the money to.<BR>
If there is no 100% vote yes, some people may choose not to give their money.<BR>
This can be decided by voters, during voting or later. (check here: if vote=fail, keep money.)<BR>
If you do not vote, your money is not given away.<BR>
<BR>
6. There should be follow up on the receiver of the money<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
7. If someone wants to withdraw his or hers own money from the money library, one is free to do so.<BR>
(Paypal transfer fund have to be paid by the donor.)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
