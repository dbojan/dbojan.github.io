prepare the best way you can.<BR>
like in video games read walktrough, before you play.<BR>
use all you can use to improve your chances of success.<BR>
no cheating!<BR>
<BR>
imagine studying where students are not afraid of teacher.<BR>
where students cannot fail.<BR>
If the knowledge shown is lacking, they are simply asked to review the part againg<BR>
and come back when they have. And offered help if needed. In time of the teacher or other students, who are willing to help.<BR>
<BR>
Where teachers enlighten the students, transfer their knowledge<BR>
Where students are not afraid to question old methods.<BR>
<BR>
students would have unlimited "semesters of time" to learn the subject.<BR>
and they would have recorded lessons, in case they wish to review them again.<BR>
they would be able to ask the lecturer, and have access to faq.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Imagine if students would study, with the same passion they play video games.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
