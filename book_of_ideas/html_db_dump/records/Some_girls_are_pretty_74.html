Accept that. It does not mean they are perfect, or their life is perfect. Or they make all the right decisions. They make mistakes like everyone else.<BR>
Their look is just one aspect of their personality. It's not who they are.<BR>
A lot of girls are insecure about their looks. Even the pretty ones.<BR>
There will be some girls who will not like you, and who will never go out  with you. Live with that. <BR>
Some girls will just want you as a friend. You should consider yourself lucky.<BR>
<BR>
You can find beauty in everyone, if you look close enough.<BR>
<BR>
Try to look at them as a person, instead as a sexual prey.<BR>
They have dreams, ambitions, ideas, fears.<BR>
They have childhood, parents, friends and relatives too. :)<BR>
They ARE human beings.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
