You will experience confusion (con-fusion :), wondering if you were wrong.<BR>
<BR>
And you will weather :) it.<BR>
You will be stronger for it. (Unless it kills you :)<BR>
<BR>
You will return, to be united with the Source, the Creator.<BR>
<BR>
And you will say:<BR>
That was fun :)<BR>
