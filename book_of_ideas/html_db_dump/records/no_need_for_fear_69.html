Or greed coming from fear.<BR>
There is enough for everybody.<BR>
Only love can save us. Be nice to others. if they are not nice to you, it is probably because they have a lot on their minds. Do not judge them. You do not know them, you do not know their history, you do not know their world, you do not know their universe.<BR>
