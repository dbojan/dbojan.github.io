(Field of dreams) <BR>
<BR>
Don't lose/forget the child inside of you.<BR>
Don't lose hope.<BR>
<BR>
Remember how happy you were when you were a kid?<BR>
Do not forget/lose that.<BR>
<BR>
Stay playful. :)<BR>
Don't stop dreaming. <BR>
Nothing is impossible.<BR>
The only thing stopping you is you. Don't.<BR>
You have no limits.<BR>
Do not be afraid to try. You are not aware of what you are able/capable to do.<BR>
Do not be afraid of the opportunity when it comes. Do not fear it. When it is waiting for you.<BR>
You can do it. You are not aware, what awesome things you are capable of. <BR>
(Until you try, and succeed. Or fail and try again, or at least learn something :)<BR>
You cannot fail God. He knows how many tries you will need :)<BR>
Even if you fail, it is not unsuccessful if you tried.<BR>
Or you might just succeed. :) But, do not be afraid to try.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You can still be serious and playful, when needed.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
