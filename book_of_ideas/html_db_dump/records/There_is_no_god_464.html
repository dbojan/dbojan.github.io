There is no god. <BR>
Not in a sense they taught you.<BR>
Omnipotent being throwing things at you, making decisions for you. Instead of you.<BR>
<BR>
There is the source. There is the universe created by the source. <BR>
There are laws in the universe, such as laws of creation, or law of attraction.<BR>
There are gods, advanced beings, seeking to command humans. They are the ones that want to be worshiped. <BR>
Why would omnipotent being want to be worshiped? Why would the source wanted to be worshiped?<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand if gods are omnipotent, why would they want to be worshiped?<BR>
Hence the gods are not omnipotent, they need us to worship them, to believe in them.<BR>
They might be powerful, advanced, but not omnipotent. Most of them are humanoid life forms.<BR>
If we put our faith in them, and not in us, we give away OUR power to them. <BR>
Then they will have the power over us.<BR>
<BR>
In words of Captain Kirk: "Why would God need a ship"<BR>
Isn't he omnipotent? All powerful?<BR>
<BR>
The source, on the other hand, is omnipotent, but does not need our worship, and pretty much lets us <BR>
do what we want with our life. (He is more like a guide, a parent to us? Someone to speak to and ask for an advice? A mother, a loving parent?)<BR>
Remember the law of causality. What goes around comes around. Every action has a reaction.<BR>
Since we exist in a linear time, the results might not be obvious immediately.<BR>
<BR>
So, it is up to you. You decide your future. You make the choices. You believe in yourself. Not in someone up in <BR>
the sky, or heaven, deciding upon your future.<BR>
Your future depends on ... you :). So, you better listen to yourself :)<BR>
