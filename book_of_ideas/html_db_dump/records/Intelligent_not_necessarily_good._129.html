If a race is technologically advanced, it does not necessarily mean they are good to all, and kind.<BR>
<BR>
No matter how much we as a society technologically advance, until we let the love in, it does not mean we are advanced.<BR>
<BR>
Actually it might be just the opposite.<BR>
If people in power only think of a new technology as a way to kill more, and more efficiently, it means it has bigger chances of destroying itself, the planet, or both.<BR>
We are just a passengers on this planet. We do not own it. It is higher than we are.<BR>
<BR>
If we are not careful, we might have to say some day: "Fools. We had it all, but we lost/ruined it."<BR>
(quote from Planet of the apes?, appropriately :) )<BR>
Let's hope we get smarter, and get back on the right track. <BR>
Let's hope the greed does not get the better of us.<BR>
Let the sunshine in.<BR>
