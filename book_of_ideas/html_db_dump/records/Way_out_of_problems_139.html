Afraid we'll lose what little unhappiness we have, we are afraid to move on.<BR>
There is no need for fear.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.<BR>
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:<BR>
He leadeth me beside the still waters.<BR>
He restoreth my soul:<BR>
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name' sake.<BR>
<BR>
 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<BR>
I will fear no evil: For thou art with me;<BR>
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.<BR>
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies;<BR>
Thou annointest my head with oil; My cup runneth over.<BR>
<BR>
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,<BR>
and I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever.<BR>
<BR>
The 23rd Psalm<BR>
