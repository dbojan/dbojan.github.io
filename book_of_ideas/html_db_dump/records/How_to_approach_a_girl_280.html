Do not wait for the other party to make the first step. Maybe she is waiting for you.<BR>
If she is interested, you will see the signs. If you ask her out and she is not interested, that is ok too. She will probably be flattered.<BR>
But, if possible first check if she returns the invitation. (The smile, or looking at each other slightly longer then it is usual.)<BR>
Accidental brush of your bodies together, touching your shoulder, removing loose hair from your clothes, <BR>
standing close, looking at you longer than usual, asking personal questions, smiling at you jokes.<BR>
Respond back.<BR>
<BR>
Just look into her eyes. You'll feel the connection. Or make one :), perhaps.<BR>
Anyway, it is better than staring at her breasts.  Not to mention it's rude. To stare.<BR>
<BR>
Ask her out/on a drink, or ask her personal questions, return the stare, smile.<BR>
Do not worry about the outcome, asking someone out usually lifts other people's self-confidence.<BR>
<BR>
It's OK to be nervous about it. Breathe deeply and you'll feel better.<BR>
Maybe you imagine girls to be perfect. They are not, unfortunately. They are humans, like most of us.<BR>
Girls can be lost just as lost as we are. Sometimes they are scared, nervous,  insecure or clumsy. :)<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes you win with girls, sometimes you don't.<BR>
Sometimes we are scared or insecure.<BR>
<BR>
And, in time, you will be in a person being asked out. :). Even if you say no, it is not so bad.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
