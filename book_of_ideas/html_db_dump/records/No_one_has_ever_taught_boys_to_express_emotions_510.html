They are taught expressing emotions makes them weak, which is not true.<BR>
<BR>
So the only way they now how to express emotions is through violence.<BR>
Through drinking. Through money.<BR>
<BR>
They should learn to express their emotions through saying how they feel, singing, and dancing.<BR>
It will not hurt them to cry every now and then :)<BR>
<BR>
They should learn to express their emotions. Girls have already "mastered" this. :)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
