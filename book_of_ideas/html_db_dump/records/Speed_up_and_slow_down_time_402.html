When you are late slow it down. Let it unwind later when you have more freee time.<BR>
When you have to wait for someone or something, speed it up.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe the time does pass faster when you are excited?<BR>
Or when you are having fun.<BR>
So you could speed up time, by having fun, or telling yourself you do.<BR>
And slow it down, it by not having fun :).<BR>
<BR>
But it would only be subjective.<BR>
But what if time is only subjective, not objective? :)<BR>
<BR>
(Perhaps we can not influence time, only our perception of time, or lack thereof.)<BR>
<BR>
If we consider light trapped, slowed down = matter.<BR>
Can time be slowed down too?<BR>
<BR>
partly form sf story with robots, having time some sort of time slowing device.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
