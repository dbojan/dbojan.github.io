The more you train your mind, the better your body is.<BR>
<BR>
Yor mind creates its reaity.<BR>
Your body can only be as good as mind allows it.<BR>
<BR>
It can go only as far as your mind "pushes" it.<BR>
To your mind, there are  no limits .<BR>
<BR>
Nothing is impossible, in this virtual reality.<BR>
<BR>
Have fun :)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
