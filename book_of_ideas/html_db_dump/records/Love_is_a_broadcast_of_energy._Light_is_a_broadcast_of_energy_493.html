Living forms can feel it. Animals, humans and plants. And planets, too :)<BR>
<BR>
Love your beautiful planet.<BR>
<BR>
Light and love is energy broadcast(ed)<BR>
When you get anxious/stressed you push negative energy inside of you to you(r liver?)<BR>
<BR>
How to remove toxins from your body?<BR>
Breathe. Imagine negative energy leaving your live and your body.<BR>
Breathe in. Imagine positive enregy, health and peace entering your body.<BR>
Breathe out. Imagine negative enregy, stress and unhealth leaving your body.<BR>
<BR>
Repeat these phrases as your breathe in, and out.<BR>
<BR>
Make your liver sing. :)<BR>
<BR>
Talk about your problems with someone. Friends, unknowns?, pidgeons in the park, ball with the face painted on it :), or even tell them to your self. <BR>
For example, you can tell them to your self. Be your own confindant.<BR>
<BR>
Just don't keep your problems inside of yourself. They will wear you down. Instead, you should wear them out. :)<BR>
<BR>
If you are student, when you think about the written exam you had, do not worry about what you wrote. You cannot change it.<BR>
Instead accept it, learn from it, and tell yourself you will do (even) better next time.<BR>
<BR>
Tell yourself I will worry about it in 40 minutes, or later, or ... never :).<BR>
<BR>
That is why women live longer, cause they talk about their problems, and release, remove negative energy from their body.<BR>
Men, unfortunately dont talk as much about their problems with other men. Maybe only during some physical activity.<BR>
<BR>
Plants and animals can fell energy, and grow/move towards it. When we send them love, they send love back to us.<BR>
<BR>
Planet (and our surroundings), can fell energy. When we send love to it, it sends us back love and positive energy<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
