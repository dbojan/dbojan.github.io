There is nothing wrong with sex, though :) . Or with us.<BR>
Sex should be physical manifestation of love. One of many.<BR>
<BR>
Dish out love*. Reach out to others with love. Not with sex(ual propositions).<BR>
cause other people wish you good.<BR>
<BR>
It's like name of that old video game "Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (In Several Wrong Places)" :)<BR>
<BR>
*Instead of fear. Love.<BR>
