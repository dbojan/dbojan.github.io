<b>No TV</b><BR>
TV is bad because it keeps your mind occupied with stupid things. Life of TV stars.<BR>
Life of the characters in the soap operas. Life of other people. People you dont't even know, and probably will newer meet.<BR>
Show made for you to watch it. What story has to be told in 100 half an hour episodes?<BR>
These shows are made to keep you glued to TV, so you don't think about anything else. A sleeping pill. Nice and easy escape from reality.<BR>
When you stand up from the couch do you remember what you just watched? Where did last two hours go?<BR>
<BR>
Or Big brother, where there is no content. People volunteer to have other people watch them 24/7?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Commercials</b> that tell you, you will feel better and be more successful if you buy their product. Creating yet another industry.<BR>
<BR>
Candy industry. Sugar. The more you have it, the more you want it. Does that remind you of something?<BR>
Movie industry. Keeping you entertained. With mostly violence and stupidity. <BR>
Shampoo industry. See natural shampoo.<BR>
Deodorant industry. See natural deodorant.<BR>
Plastic industry. See hemp.<BR>
Oil industry. See hemp, for example. Or alternative fuel. "Who killed the electric car" the movie.<BR>
Drugs industry. See natural medicine, hemp oil...<BR>
Video games industry. What is the objective in 99% of video games? To kill.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Each new product you just bought will be overcome by newer and better next year.<BR>
Do you really need new stuff? Or do you have to have them, just because everyone else has them?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>News</b> on tv make you angry at others. Or feeling depressed, sad or lonely. Pushing people into war. Manipulating reality.<BR>
Sports make you divide in groups and cheer against eachother.<BR>

<BR>
Read a book. Look up something on the internet. Anything. But don't hang too much around news sites, or entertain-ment sites.<BR>
Try various searches on Google. :) Anything that comes up in your mind.<BR>
<BR>
Or go outside with friends.<BR>
<BR>

<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment">Entertainment</a></b><BR>
A major criticism of entertainment is that it diverts people's time and money away from activities that are considered meaningful (volunteering, studying etc.) <BR>
For example, watching movies and reading fiction are considered by many to be a waste of time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses">Bread and circuses</a></b><BR>
the phrase is used to describe the creation of public approval, not through exemplary or excellent public service or public policy, but through the <BR>
mere satisfaction of the immediate, shallow requirements of a populace. The phrase also implies the erosion or ignorance of civic duty amongst <BR>
the concerns of the common man (l'homme moyen sensuel).<BR>
In modern usage, the phrase has become an adjective to describe a populace that no longer values civic virtues and the public life. <BR>
To many across the political spectrum, left and right, it connotes the triviality and frivolity that characterized the Roman Empire prior to its decline.<BR>
<BR>
Don't spend all your time on entertainment. Especially not on TV. Try some nice music on radio if you have to listen to something.<BR>
<BR>

Don't be embroiled in any local story. Of hating, of bad news, of ads. It is just a story. It is only real if you let it be real ;).<BR>
