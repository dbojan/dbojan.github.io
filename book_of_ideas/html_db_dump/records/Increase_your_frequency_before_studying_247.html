Meditate?<BR>
<BR>
Clear the mind before you start studying. You will learn more easily if you don't try so hard. <BR>
You should not be afraid that you will not to remember things you're trying to learn.<BR>
<BR>
If you accept something as a game you will learn it faster then when you try hard to learn. Cause you will be relaxed. You will not say I must learn.<BR>
Instead, you will say I can learn this.<BR>
What would happen if I try this. Or this way. What if...?<BR>
<BR>
Your body is like a wire. Don't keep it tight all the time.<BR>
Relax that wire a little.<BR>
Relax your body a little.<BR>
<BR>
If you hold tight, there is no energy flow.<BR>
When you relax, you will remember easily, and learn more easily.<BR>
<BR>
"If you tighten the string too much it will snap; and if you leave it too slack, it won't play." from the movie "Little Buddha"<BR>

<BR>
Take test by yourself. Fake one, and then grade yourself.<BR>
