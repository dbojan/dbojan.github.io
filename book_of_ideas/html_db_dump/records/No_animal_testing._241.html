There should not be testing anything on animals, there should not be testing anything on humans.<BR>
Whatever the goal is not worth it.<BR>
Science can advance by looking insides of ourselves, by observing the nature.<BR>
Not by mutilating, pain and suffering<BR>
<BR>
There will be no advance in science till we open ourselves to love and God.<BR>
<BR>
And start asking why?<BR>
Without hurting anyone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Oath of the Scientist<BR>
I swear to use my scientific knowledge for the good of Humanity. I promise never to harm any person in my search for enlightenment.<BR>
<BR>
I shall be courageous and careful in my quest for greater knowledge about the mysteries that surround us. I shall not use scientific knowledge for my own personal gain or give it to those who seek to destroy the wonderful planet on which we live.<BR>
<BR>
If I break this oath, may the beauty and wonder of the Universe forever remain hidden from me.<BR>
