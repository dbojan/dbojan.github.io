They are probably the only ones who care for you because of you, not because they want something from you.<BR>
Listen to them, and what they say to you. Based on past experiences, would they want to hurt you?<BR>
But, use your own head.<BR>
<BR>
They usually are on your side, and have no financial or any other reason to lie to you.<BR>
They are usually not interested in getting money from you.<BR>
Most people that want to make a deal with you (in real life) are motivated by getting money, <BR>
Not all, though. Just be aware. If you are making contract, imagine the worst possibility, and add it to the contract.<BR>
Or protect yourself from it in the contract. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Imagine you had a puppy. It left in the noon, but did not came, even late in the night.<BR>
Would you be worried?<BR>
Now imagine your parents feeling like that for you, only 10 times more.<BR>
Do you understand now, why your parents ask you to come home early every night?<BR>
They are not trying to ruin your going outs with your friends, they are just worried, and<BR>
do not want anything bad happening to you.<BR>
<BR>
Remember, when you were a baby, your parents would wake up in the middle of the night to feed you. :)<BR>
When you were sick they would take you to see the doctor.<BR>
They feed you and clothe you. Could it be they love you, and have your best interest at heart?<BR>
<BR>
Please, if you do something bad, tell your parents. They know you are not perfect, (nobody is), and you <BR>
make mistakes like we all do. You might be afraid, but lying will not help you to get out of the mess.<BR>
Telling the truth will show good faith/will.<BR>
<BR>
There are some small percentage of people that are unsuitable to be parents. <BR>
They usually consume a lot of alcohol, or use drugs. If you see someone using drugs, or getting drunk all the<BR>
time, get away from them. Ask for help from cousins, or friends. DO NOT just run out of the house. <BR>
It could be a jungle out there.<BR>
<BR>
That is why I say think about the past events.<BR>
<BR>
If you feel you are abused by your parents, speak to someone. Your teacher, your friend, their parents, <BR>
doctor, cousins, even a policeman. There is also "help phone". Do not be afraid to call for help. It is not your fault.<BR>
<BR>
Or if you feel abused in school or in a working place.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
