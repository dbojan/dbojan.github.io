That someone is going to hit our car, that someone is going to ransack our house.<BR>
We get angry when we might get, or get, into car accident.<BR>
We should not be. Material things by their nature are temporary. They will dissolve in time.<BR>
There is no need for fear. No need for anger over losing things, or getting them damaged.<BR>
You can't take them to the grave anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Those are valuable lessons anyway. Try to watch yourself in such an event. You might be surprised by yourself. :)<BR>
You might learn a lot.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
