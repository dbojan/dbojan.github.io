Tells you what to think. You have to watch and listen.<BR>
And then people complain they do not have enough time.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike TV, you can think, while listening to a radio. (Beware of violent, angry music, though)<BR>
And hear yourself thinking.<BR>
<BR>
Listen to radio (but skip news, and commercials if possible), dance, sing,<BR>
read a book, or go out, with or without friends.<BR>
Or spend the time in the nature, or with animals.<BR>
Either way you might meet someone (new).<BR>
<BR>
What do you do, with all this free time?<BR>
I intend to evolve. And (by) love.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
