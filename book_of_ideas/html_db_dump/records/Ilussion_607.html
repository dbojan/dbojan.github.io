I am free of false beliefs.<BR>

Porn is an illusion. It is meant to stimulate your pleasure centers. There is no love in it.<BR>
The more you get it the more you require. It is like sugar.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is just an illusion. It is created to entrap you.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To separate you from yourself and from others.<BR>
<BR>
Only love is real.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
