Not how others people treat you, but how you treat other people.<BR>

Think (before you act). They usually have their reasons for acting the way they do.<BR>
They and their reasons are mostly unknown to you. Perhaps they feel cornered, or are scared, or are just greedy :) . <BR>
Do not judge them, less you be judged.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
