Remember to have fun in the darkest hour. And to laugh/smile/keep the good spirit :)<BR>
Remember the happy thoughts (Like Peter pan)<BR>
Sing happy songs, like girls like to do :)<BR>
<BR>
That bad thing, it is just a localized event. A spectacle for players, a stage for actors :)<BR>
<BR>
"All the world is stage"<BR>
<BR>
There is nothing to fear except the fear itself.<BR>
<BR>
And, remember to blink. Literally. When reading... letters :)<BR>
<BR>
perserverance<BR>
from the outside, looking in ... at the stage ... :)<BR>
You, looking at yourself ... (from the outside?)<BR>
