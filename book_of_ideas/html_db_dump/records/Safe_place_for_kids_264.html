Every child should have a happy home to come to.<BR>
Filled with light, warmth, and love.<BR>
<BR>
I wish all kids had a safe place to come home to. To grow up in.<BR>
Place to sleep. Shelter. Enough to eat. Clothes to wear.<BR>
Parents that love them. To shelter them in love. While they grow up, and beyond.<BR>
(Free) access to education. And (accessible) health/medical treatment if needed.<BR>
If not free, then accessible, or nearly free. Cheap. Which should not mean bad.<BR>
<BR>
Who ever brought money into medicine... is wrong. Life is not something people should bargain about.<BR>
If so many people pay taxes, shouldn't the country take care of them, and their health, their life?<BR>
Some countries have free health system. Or nearly free. Have you seen movie Sicko?<BR>
Some countries do not.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
