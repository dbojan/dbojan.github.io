Young men are thought the only way to express themselves is through violence and bad language.<BR>
In the end, they will turn to the only thing they have been shown, the thing they have been bombarded with from tv, from movies,<BR>
even from news: violence. Rarely something sane can be seen on tv. Instead of listening to the stories of the old, of the bravery, <BR>
humanity, and heroism, young people today are bombarded with senseless stories full of violence, where only thieves and rogues profit.<BR>
And their ways are presented as normal, which they are not.<BR>
Instead they should be told the stories of friendship, and heroism, and bravery.<BR>
<BR>
Young women are taught that the only way to happiness is material, which is wrong. Money can bring you safety, <BR>
but not necessarily happiness.<BR>
<BR>
There are no shortcuts in this world. To "succeed" (earn a lot of money) fast, you have to give up something. Usually a lot.<BR>
The problem is, you will only notice the value of the lost, after you lose it.<BR>
<BR>
They should spend more time with their parents and grandparents, who should teach them how to be human.<BR>
Video games? There are some video games that do not consider violence a main selling point.<BR>
<BR>
What about talk, sing, dance, crying? Crying is considered a shame, which is nonsense.<BR>
Rarely people know how to have discussion without violence and heated words. It is possible to have a discussion with someone<BR>
and still retain a respect for them.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
