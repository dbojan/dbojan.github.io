I was just thinking this morning. If Jesus came to me and ask me to leave everything and go with him on a .. journey, would I accept? Or would I want to experience material things, hold on to things, and perhaps people?<BR>

Do we own things or do they own us? If we own them, can we just leave them one day?<BR>
<BR>
And what about things that bring us pleasure? Are we attached to them, because we like the pleasure they bring?  Like hooks into our pleasure centers. (Tactics used by dark forces?).  Big cars, power? Can we let all this go?<BR>

Material things are temporary. After some time they will disappear ... back into energy they came from. Energy is eternal. Love is the highest (frequency) energy. On the top, there is love. :)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
