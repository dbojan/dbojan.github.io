Are they scared?<BR>
Maybe something or someone else is bothering them. <BR>
Annoyed by someone they can't raise their voice at? Their anger might not be pointed at you.<BR>
Try not to judge them.<BR>
What are their motives? Maybe the truth would not suite them. Maybe they are afraid of change? Maybe they are cornered.<BR>
Maybe they are scared.<BR>
Just stop and think for a little.<BR>
Think not just what is being said, but why it is being said. (And who would profit from it. And who has no interest here.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ask them "What is the real issue here?" <BR>
<BR>
There is no need to feel threaten by what some people say. Their words or action cannot hurt you :).<BR>
They action cannot hurt you, just whistling of the wind in the distance cannot hurt you. Learn to laugh it off.<BR>
It is totally unimportant. :). <BR>
<BR>
Even if you make mistake, learn from it, apologize and move on. Remember what you did wrong, and try to do better next time.<BR>
<BR>
Unless it is well-intentioned criticism. You will learn to recognize these by the people that give them. Think of<BR>
their actions in the past? Were they beneficiary towards you?<BR>
