</center><P><P>tags: <a href='../tags/communication.html'>communication</a>  <p>Women share (talk), that is how they get intimate with their girlfriends.<BR>
I tell you my problem, you tell me yours. She expects man to tell her his problem(s).<BR>
<BR>
Men don't share. If they talk about problem with some guy, that means they cannot solve it on their own.<BR>
I tell you my problem, you tell me solution. Also it means I am unable to solve the problem on my own, and sort of... weak.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now when woman tells her problem to a man, he gives her solution. That, however is not what she expects.<BR>
So she keeps talking.<BR>
Man perceive this as not appreciating advice. So they complain. "She just keeps on talking"<BR>
So they tune out.<BR>
<BR>
Women see this as not wanting to get intimate.<BR>
<BR>
Men establish order in pack, by giving orders to low-level members.<BR>
<BR>
Women "give order" to do something, like hang a painting, men see this as being a lower rang than women.<BR>
Women do not see it the same way. They see this a proof of love.<BR>
