No other contract is signed with expectancy till the rest of your life. Plus it creates pressure of having to succeed. Instead they should agree on signing the contract, the proceedings for ending the contract. Rules, a contingency plan.<BR>
<BR>
No one can guarantee the matters of the heart.<BR>
You can not tell heart what to feel. Not now, not in ten years. Besides, no one knows how you will feel ten years from now.<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
