What would YOU like to happen?<BR>
What would YOU like your future to look like?<BR>
<BR>
Say it:<BR>
This is what is going to happen:<BR>
I am going to...<BR>
or<BR>
I intend to.<BR>
<BR>
Know this to be truth. Believe in this.<BR>
And it will happen. :)<BR>
<BR>
Don't let the river strem carry you, as it wants.<BR>
Be the captain of your ship.<BR>
