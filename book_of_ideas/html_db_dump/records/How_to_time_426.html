<BR>
why do we have so much clocks?<BR>
so we cannot control time?<BR>
<BR>
if we are told the time always moves at the same speed we cannot control it, cannot travel it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
or so we can control time.<BR>
Is time personal, subjective thing? Yes?<BR>
<BR>
When does time moves the slowest? When you look at the clock.<BR>
So in order to slow down time just look at the clock. :)<BR>
<BR>
Some might say: Live in a moment. Now. :)<BR>
<BR>
Or make it like you are boring ,so time slows down.<BR>
(Everybody knows this.)<BR>
