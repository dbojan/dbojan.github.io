<BR>
Nothing is worth ruining your health.<BR>
You are not the first or the last with this kind of problem<BR>
People before you survived. So will you.<BR>
<BR>
If you tighten the string to much it will break.<BR>
Loose a little.<BR>
<BR>
Step a side. Distract yourself for a while. Laugh, joke.<BR>
You will have a better (point of) view.<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes you get an answer before you ask. (From the universe/Source)<BR>
