Example:<BR>
Girl is doing something. Ask her if she needs help, or better yet, come and start helping.<BR>
(Girls prefer it if they do not have to ask you to help her, so oferr help, or start helping on your own. )<BR>
<BR>
If she says she needs help don't just stand there. Start the work, help her, don't wait for her to tell you what to do.<BR>
If you stand lost she will not think too highly of you. So, show some initiative. If you make a mistake, make a joke, and/or smile and move on :)<p> <a href=""></a></body></html>
