To be in love with someone - to can't imagine your life without someone. Energies intertwined, like two tree branches.<BR>
<BR>
You can't pretend to be in love someone just to be nice to that person.<BR>
You should not do that.<BR>
That is not fair to that person.<BR>
That is lie.<BR>
<BR>
There is a difference between compassion and pity.<BR>
Compassion is OK, but don't pity people.<BR>
Most people don't like to be pitied.<BR>
<BR>
Just be honest. To yourself and to others.<BR>
<BR>
Do not lie to girls.<BR>
If you lie about something, and they will found out, they will think your love is lie.<BR>
They will think everything you ever said was a lie.<BR>
<BR>
But if she is the one, hold her. Be her light, like she is yours.<BR>
<BR>
