What is your ideal working place? Say it!

You are the leader, the boss of your life. Set it the way you want, instead of grieving.

Any ride he is interesting, regardless of the ending part.

How come love turns to hate in marriage sometimes? What happens to the
butterflies feeling in the stomach? How come I can't stand being without her,
turns to I can't stand being next to her? I guess all of the unsaid words
create an avalanche, an explosion.

Let's make this fun.

Girls always expect love to last forever.
That's why they are so happy on the date they get married.
