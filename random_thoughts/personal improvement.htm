Imagine your body renewing itself.
Say your self: I am a healthy person.
Imagine a beam of energy coming from Sun or from God to you and healing / revitalizing/ rejuvenating you.
Imagine an egg shaped shield of energy around your body.
Imagine your body becoming light.
Have nice thoughts. Marbles :)
Imagine energy surrounding your body
Imagine being happy.
Smile at yourself.
Wish yourself sweet dreams.

<hr>

What is the perfect life for you? Well, why aren't you living it?
