The 10 Commandments are found in the Bible's Old Testament at Exodus, Chapter 20. 
The tradition is that they were given directly by God to the people of Israel at 
Mount Sinai after He had delivered them from slavery in Egypt:

"And God spoke all these words, saying: 'I am the LORD your God…

ONE: 'You shall have no other gods before Me.'

TWO: 'You shall not make for yourself a carved image--any likeness of anything 
that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the 
water under the earth.'

THREE: 'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.'

FOUR: 'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.'

FIVE: 'Honor your father and your mother.'

SIX: 'You shall not murder.'

SEVEN: 'You shall not commit adultery.'

EIGHT: 'You shall not steal.'

NINE: 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.'

TEN: 'You shall not covet your neighbour's house; you shall not covet your 
neighbour's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor 
his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbour's.'
