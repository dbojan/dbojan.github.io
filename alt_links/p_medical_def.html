Definitions from MEDICAL DICTIONARY:

Clitoris: A small mass of erectile tissue situated at the anterior 
apex of the vestibule.

Penis: Defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as the "intromittent" 
organ of the male. ("Intromittent " is defined as "That intromits or 
introduces; having the function of intromission"). In Latin, "penis" 
originally meant "a tail."

Vagina: The muscular canal extending from the cervix to the outside of
the body. The word "vagina" is a Latin word meaning "a sheath or scabbard",
a scabbard into which one might slide and sheath a sword. The "sword" in
the case of the anatomic vagina was the penis. Love and war, it would 
seem, have been connected in the minds of people for millenia.

Vulva: The external genitalia of the female. 

Breast: The anterior aspect of the chest or the mammary gland. 
The latter is composed of primarily fat in which there is a complex 
branching duct network from the nipple inward. In the female, 
lobules develop at the end of the ducts to produce milk.


Testicles: The male sex glands. The testicles produce and store sperm
and are the major source of testosterone.


orgasm: The apex and culmination of sexual excitement.

Origin: Gr. Orgasmos = swelling or organ to swell, to be lustful

[Latin, witness, testis. See testify.]

    Word History: The resemblance between testimony, testify, testis, and testicle shows an 
    etymological relationship, but linguists are not agreed on precisely how English testis
    came to have its current meaning. The Latin testis originally meant “witness,” and 
    etymologically means “third (person) standing by”: the te- part comes from an older 
    tri-, a combining form of the word for “three,” and -stis is a noun derived from the 
    Indo-European root st- meaning “stand.” How this also came to refer to the body part(s) 
    is disputed. An old theory has it that the Romans placed their right hands on their 
    testicles and swore by them before giving testimony in court. Another theory says 
    that the sense of testicle in Latin testis is due to a calque, or loan translation, 
    from Greek. The Greek noun parastats means “defender (in law), supporter” (para- “by, 
    alongside,” as in paramilitary and -stats from histanai, “to stand”). In the dual number, 
    used in many languages for naturally occurring, contrasting, or complementary pairs such
    as hands, eyes, and ears, parastats had the technical medical sense “testicles,” that
    is “two glands side by side.” The Romans simply took this sense of parastats and added
    it to testis, the Latin word for legal supporter, witness.

   2. Females or males considered as a group.

sex:

/seks/ [Sun Users' Group & elsewhere] n. 1. Software
EXchange. A technique invented by the blue-green algae hundreds of
millions of years ago to speed up their evolution, which had been
terribly slow up until then. Today, SEX parties are popular among
hackers and others (of course, these are no longer limited to
exchanges of genetic software). In general, SEX parties are a Good
Thing, but unprotected SEX can propagate a virus. See also
pubic directory. 2. The rather Freudian mnemonic often used for
Sign EXtend, a machine instruction found in the PDP-11 and many
other architectures. The RCA 1802 chip used in the early Elf and
SuperElf personal computers had a `SEt X register' SEX instruction,
but this seems to have had little folkloric impact. The Data
General instruction set also had `SEX'.

DEC's engineers nearly got a PDP-11 assembler that used the
`SEX' mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for once) marketing
wasn't asleep and forced a change. That wasn't the last time this
happened, either. The author of "The Intel 8086 Primer", who was
one of the original designers of the 8086, noted that there was
originally a `SEX' instruction on that processor, too. He says that
Intel management got cold feet and decreed that it be changed, and
thus the instruction was renamed `CBW' and `CWD' (depending on what
was being extended). Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the microcontroller
used in IBM PC keyboards) is also missing straight `SEX' but has
logical-or and logical-and instructions `ORL' and `ANL'.

The Motorola 6809, used in the Radio Shack Color Computer and in
U.K.'s `Dragon 32' personal computer, actually had an official `SEX'
instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II with which it competed did
not. British hackers thought this made perfect mythic sense; after
all, it was commonly observed, you could (on some theoretical level)
have sex with a dragon, but you can't have sex with an apple.
