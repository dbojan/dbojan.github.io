Imagine

Imagine there's no heaven,
It's easy if you try,
No hell below us,
Above us only sky,
Imagine all the people
living for today...

Imagine there's no countries,
It isn't hard to do,
Nothing to kill or die for,
No religion too,
Imagine all the people
living life in peace...

Imagine no possessions ,
I wonder if you can,
No need for greed or hunger,
A brotherhood of man,
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

You may say I'm a dreamer,
but I'm not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And the world will live as one

By John Lennon


some of my ideas about the song:
no heaven no hell: - No reason to entice us with heaven, or scare us with or hell.
	Listen to your conscience.
	The law is simple: You will reap what you sow, be it good or bad.

There's no countries...- nothing to divide us. The way religion, countries, languages divide us.
	Divide and conquer - that is an old proverb. Who rules over us? 
	Who has to profit the most by keeping us divided?
	There is the story of Babylonian tower...

No need for greed or hunger - wars are fought because of the fear there will not be enough.
	People become thieves, because they are afraid they will not have enough. People kill each other in wars
	because their war leaders or priests or shamans told them to. They scare them with enemy.
	You can see this in the the scene from animated movie "Pocahontas", where war leaders tell the other party is demon.
	The truth is, we are all brothers and sisters, and  as such, should treat each others with respect and love.

Brotherhood of men- threat others as brothers and sisters. let love guide you, not fear.

And the world will live as one - together, there is no limit to what we can achieve. 
	Not to mention happiness and harmony with nature.
